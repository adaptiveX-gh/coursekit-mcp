# CourseKit Skills - Practical Implementation Example

## How Skills Enhance MCP Tools - Live Example

### Scenario: Creating an AI Coding Workshop

## Without Skills (MCP Only)
```
Human: Use coursekit.constitution with vision: "Create an AI workshop"

Claude: [Calls coursekit.constitution with minimal input]

Result: Generic constitution with many assumptions
```

## With Skills (Guided Approach)

### Initial Interaction
```
Human: I need to create a workshop on AI coding assistants

Claude using Constitution Builder Skill: 

Excellent! I'll help you build a comprehensive foundation for your AI coding 
assistants workshop. Let me gather some key information to ensure we create 
the best possible constitution.

**Let's start with the problem you're solving:**

When you think about developers in your organization, what specific challenge 
with AI coding assistants are they facing? 

For example:
- Are they hesitant to adopt AI tools due to security concerns?
- Do they struggle with writing effective prompts?
- Are they overwhelmed by the variety of tools available?
- Is there resistance from management or team members?

What brought you to create this workshop?
```

### Information Gathering Continues
```
Human: Our senior developers are falling behind because they don't trust AI 
tools and think they're just toys. They're missing out on huge productivity 
gains.

Claude: That's a crucial challenge - skeptical senior developers missing out 
on real productivity benefits. This context will help shape the workshop 
perfectly.

**Now let's understand your audience better:**

These senior developers who are skeptical:
- How many years of experience do they typically have?
- What languages/frameworks do they primarily work with?
- What's their biggest concern about AI? (security, quality, job replacement?)
- Have they tried any AI tools before, or completely avoided them?
- What would convince them it's worth their time?
