# Research Guidelines for Course Development

## Research Philosophy

### Purpose of Research in Course Development

Research for course presentations serves to:
1. **Fill content gaps** identified in the brief
2. **Add credibility** through authoritative sources
3. **Provide current information** not covered in outline or video
4. **Offer diverse perspectives** on topics
5. **Supply concrete examples** and case studies
6. **Ground claims in evidence** rather than opinion

### Research is NOT

- ❌ Comprehensive literature review
- ❌ Original research or data collection
- ❌ Exhaustive coverage of every topic
- ❌ Replacement for solid course design
- ❌ Filler for poorly structured content

## Source Quality Evaluation

### The CRAAP Test

Use this framework to evaluate sources:

**C - Currency**
- When was it published or last updated?
- Is the information outdated for your topic?
- Are links or references still working?

**R - Relevance**
- Does it relate directly to your research need?
- Is it at the right level for your audience?
- Does it add value beyond what you already have?

**A - Authority**
- Who is the author? What are their credentials?
- Who published or sponsored it?
- Is it from a reputable organization?

**A - Accuracy**
- Is the information supported by evidence?
- Are sources cited?
- Can you verify claims independently?
- Is it peer-reviewed or editorially vetted?

**P - Purpose**
- Why was this created?
- Is it objective or biased?
- Is it trying to sell something?
- Does it present multiple perspectives?

### Source Type Hierarchy

Not all sources are equal. Use this hierarchy as a guide:

**Tier 1: Highly Credible (Prefer these)**
- Peer-reviewed academic journals
- University press books
- Government research publications
- Established research institutions
- International organizations (UN, WHO, IEEE, ACM)

**Tier 2: Generally Credible (Good for most needs)**
- Reputable news organizations (NYT, WSJ, Reuters, BBC)
- Industry white papers from established companies
- Professional association publications
- Technical documentation from authoritative sources
- Books from reputable publishers
- Conference proceedings from major conferences

**Tier 3: Useful with Caution (Verify claims)**
- Company blogs (may have bias)
- Expert blogs with credentials
- Industry analyst reports
- Trade publications
- Educational websites (.edu domains)
- Technical tutorials from known practitioners

**Tier 4: Use Sparingly (Additional verification needed)**
- General blogs
- Social media posts (even from experts)
- Wikipedia (use as starting point, not citation)
- Forums and Q&A sites (Stack Overflow, Reddit)
- Personal websites
- Marketing materials

**Avoid:**
- Sources with unknown authorship
- Obviously biased sources without acknowledgment
- Outdated information presented as current
- Sources that can't be verified
- Conspiracy or fringe websites

## Research Process

### Step 1: Define Research Questions

Transform vague needs into specific questions:

**Vague:** "Need more on cloud computing"

**Specific:**
- What percentage of enterprises use cloud services? (data)
- What are the main security concerns? (analysis)
- What's a good example of cloud migration? (case study)
- How has cloud adoption changed 2020-2024? (trend data)

### Step 2: Select Appropriate Sources

Match source type to research need:

| Research Need | Appropriate Sources |
|---------------|---------------------|
| Statistics/Data | Industry reports, government data, research studies |
| Current Trends | Recent news articles, industry analysis, surveys |
| Best Practices | Professional publications, expert blogs, case studies |
| Technical Details | Official documentation, technical books, standards |
| Examples | Case studies, company blogs, conference talks |
| Historical Context | Books, academic articles, archival materials |
| Definitions | Official standards, authoritative references, textbooks |

### Step 3: Search Strategically

**Use precise search queries:**

❌ "machine learning"
✅ "machine learning adoption rate 2024 enterprise"

**Use search operators:**
- `"exact phrase"` for exact matches
- `site:edu` to search educational sites
- `filetype:pdf` for PDFs
- `2023..2024` for date range
- `-keyword` to exclude terms

**Search in right places:**
- Google Scholar for academic sources
- Industry-specific databases
- Professional organization websites
- Company research/blog sections
- Conference proceedings
- Official documentation sites

### Step 4: Extract Efficiently

Don't read everything in full. Use strategic reading:

**Skim first:**
1. Read title and abstract/summary
2. Check publication date and author
3. Scan headings and structure
4. Read conclusion/summary
5. Decide if worth detailed reading

**Extract selectively:**
- Focus on information relevant to your specific need
- Note exact quotes if you'll use verbatim
- Capture context for statistics
- Record page numbers for reference
- Note related sources in bibliography

**Document as you go:**
- Full citation information
- Key findings relevant to your need
- Direct quotes (in quotes!)
- Your interpretation or synthesis
- How/where you'll use this in presentation

## Citation and Attribution

### Why Cite

- Gives credit to original authors
- Allows others to verify information
- Demonstrates research rigor
- Avoids plagiarism
- Builds credibility

### What to Cite

**Always cite:**
- Direct quotations
- Statistics and data
- Specific claims or findings
- Ideas from specific sources
- Images, diagrams, charts

**Generally don't cite:**
- Common knowledge in the field
- Your own analysis or synthesis
- Information from multiple sources (cite a representative few)
- Examples you create yourself

### Citation Format for Educational Materials

Use a consistent, readable format:

**For presentations (simplified format):**

```
Author. "Title." Publication, Year. [URL]
```

**Examples:**

Academic:
```
Smith, J. "Machine Learning in Healthcare."
Journal of Medical Informatics, 2024.
https://doi.org/10.xxxx
```

Industry:
```
Microsoft. "Azure Architecture Best Practices."
Microsoft Docs, 2024.
https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/architecture
```

News:
```
Johnson, A. "Cloud Adoption Surges in 2024."
TechCrunch, March 15, 2024.
https://techcrunch.com/...
```

**In-presentation citations:**

On slide:
```
75% of enterprises adopted cloud services in 2024 [1]

[1] Gartner Cloud Survey 2024
```

In speaker notes:
```
Source: Gartner. "Cloud Adoption Survey 2024."
Gartner Research, 2024.
Full citation in references slide.
```

## Research Ethics

### Plagiarism

**Definition**: Using someone else's work or ideas without attribution

**Avoid plagiarism by:**
- Citing all sources appropriately
- Using quotation marks for exact quotes
- Paraphrasing in your own words (still cite)
- Giving credit even for ideas you synthesize

### Intellectual Honesty

**Do:**
- Present information accurately
- Acknowledge limitations of research
- Note when sources disagree
- Distinguish fact from interpretation
- Update information as needed

**Don't:**
- Cherry-pick data to support predetermined conclusions
- Misrepresent what sources say
- Omit contradictory information
- Present opinion as fact
- Use outdated information without noting it

### Using AI-Generated Content

If you use AI tools for research:
- ✓ Verify all claims from AI with authoritative sources
- ✓ Treat AI output as a starting point, not a citation
- ✓ Don't cite AI directly (cite the sources it should have used)
- ✓ Be transparent about AI use if required by your institution

## Domain-Specific Considerations

### Technology and Computing

**Challenges:**
- Rapid change makes sources outdated quickly
- Commercial bias in much content
- Varying quality in tutorials and how-tos

**Best Practices:**
- Prioritize official documentation
- Use recent sources (last 1-2 years)
- Check multiple sources for current practices
- Prefer established tech publishers (O'Reilly, Manning, etc.)
- Use academic sources for fundamental concepts

### Business and Management

**Challenges:**
- Heavy marketing bias
- Anecdotal vs. research-backed claims
- Context-dependent practices

**Best Practices:**
- Look for peer-reviewed business research
- Use reputable business schools' publications
- Prefer data from established research firms
- Check methodology behind surveys and reports
- Consider industry and company context

### Science and Medicine

**Challenges:**
- Complexity of research
- Evolving understanding
- Strong need for accuracy

**Best Practices:**
- Strongly prefer peer-reviewed sources
- Check consensus vs. single study
- Look at systematic reviews and meta-analyses
- Use recent research (last 5 years unless classic study)
- Verify through multiple authoritative sources

### Creative and Design Fields

**Challenges:**
- Subjective nature of some content
- Trend-driven
- Varying professional standards

**Best Practices:**
- Use portfolios and case studies
- Cite recognized practitioners
- Reference industry-standard tools/methods
- Include diverse perspectives and styles

## Common Research Mistakes

### Mistake 1: Confirmation Bias

**Problem**: Only seeking sources that confirm pre-existing beliefs

**Solution**:
- Actively seek contradictory viewpoints
- Consider alternative explanations
- Note disagreements in research
- Present balanced perspective

### Mistake 2: Over-Reliance on Single Source

**Problem**: Using one source for multiple claims or critical information

**Solution**:
- Verify important claims with multiple sources
- Diversity of sources strengthens credibility
- Note if sources cite each other (not independent)

### Mistake 3: Outdated Information

**Problem**: Using old sources for rapidly changing topics

**Solution**:
- Check publication dates
- Note when information is from
- Supplement with recent sources
- Acknowledge when latest info unavailable

### Mistake 4: Misinterpreting Statistics

**Problem**: Citing statistics without understanding context or methodology

**Solution**:
- Read the full report, not just headlines
- Understand sample size and methodology
- Note limitations acknowledged by researchers
- Distinguish correlation from causation

### Mistake 5: Inappropriate Source Level

**Problem**: Using sources too technical or too simplistic for audience

**Solution**:
- Match source sophistication to audience level
- Translate technical sources for general audiences
- Don't oversimplify complex topics
- Provide definitions for specialized terms

## Research Documentation

### Research Notes Template

For each source, document:

```json
{
  "source_id": "unique_identifier",
  "citation": "Full citation in consistent format",
  "source_type": "academic|industry|news|documentation",
  "publication_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "accessed_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "url": "Direct link",
  "credibility_assessment": "high|medium - rationale",

  "relevance": "How this addresses research need",
  "key_findings": [
    "Specific finding 1 relevant to course",
    "Specific finding 2"
  ],
  "quotes": [
    {"quote": "Exact text", "page": "12", "usage": "where to use"}
  ],
  "data_points": [
    {"stat": "75%", "context": "of enterprises", "year": "2024"}
  ],

  "applies_to_sections": ["Module 2, Section 1"],
  "usage_notes": "How to incorporate in presentation",
  "related_sources": ["source_id_2", "source_id_3"]
}
```

### Organization Strategies

**By Section:**
- Organize research by where it will be used
- Easy to find when creating presentations
- Risk: May miss connections across sections

**By Topic:**
- Group related research together
- Good for seeing full picture of a topic
- Risk: May duplicate effort across sections

**By Source Type:**
- Academic, industry, examples, etc.
- Useful for assessing balance
- Risk: Harder to apply to specific sections

**Recommended**: Organize by section, but tag by topic and type for flexibility

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing research:

- [ ] All high-priority needs from brief are addressed
- [ ] Sources meet credibility standards
- [ ] Mix of source types (not all one type)
- [ ] Recent sources for time-sensitive topics
- [ ] Full citation information for all sources
- [ ] Key findings extracted and documented
- [ ] Clear connection to presentation sections
- [ ] Multiple sources for critical claims
- [ ] Contradictory viewpoints noted if present
- [ ] Appropriate depth for target audience

## Time Management

### Efficient Research Guidelines

**High-priority items (30+ min each):**
- Core concepts central to course
- Claims needing strong evidence
- Complex topics requiring multiple sources

**Medium-priority items (15-20 min each):**
- Supporting examples
- Standard best practices
- Background information

**Low-priority items (10 min max):**
- Quick fact checks
- Simple definitions
- Supplementary examples

### When to Stop Researching

Stop when:
- ✓ Research needs from brief are addressed
- ✓ You have sufficient evidence for claims
- ✓ You've found 2-3 good examples per section
- ✓ You have enough material for presentation depth
- ✓ Additional research provides diminishing returns

**Remember**: Presentations need clarity and evidence, not exhaustive research. Good enough is often good enough.
