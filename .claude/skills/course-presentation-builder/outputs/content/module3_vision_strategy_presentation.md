# Module 3: Vision and Strategy

## Business Agility Foundations (ICP-BAF)

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Welcome participants back
- This module builds on Module 2's team alignment foundation
- We're moving from "who we are as a team" to "where we're going and how we'll get there"
- Duration: 3 hours with one major hands-on activity
- This is where strategic clarity meets customer focus
-->

---

## Module 3 Overview

**What We'll Cover:**
- Compelling visions and clarity of purpose
- Customer empathy and value creation
- Envisioning the future state
- **Major Activity:** Foundations Sprint

**Why It Matters:**
Agile teams need clear direction + customer focus to make fast, effective decisions

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Strategic clarity is what enables autonomy
- Without clear vision and customer understanding, teams can't self-organize effectively
- The Foundations Sprint activity (60 minutes) is the centerpiece of this module
- By end of module, participants will have practical tools for strategic thinking
- Timing: 45 min + 45 min + 30 min + 60 min = 3 hours
-->

---

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Articulate the importance of compelling visions for organizational alignment
2. Apply customer empathy tools (personas, journey maps, empathy maps, value propositions)
3. Use backcasting to envision future state and plan backwards
4. Execute Foundations Sprint methodology to create strategic focus

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- These objectives align with ICAgile learning outcomes
- Mix of conceptual understanding (vision, empathy) and practical application (tools, sprint)
- Connect to business agility: clear direction + customer focus = effective autonomy
- Ask: "How many of you have a clear, compelling vision for your team or function?"
- Ask: "How many regularly use customer empathy tools in your work?"
-->

---

# Section 1: Compelling Vision and Clarity of Purpose

**Duration:** 45 minutes

---

## Section 1 Learning Objectives

- Communicate the importance of aligning organizations around a crisp, believable, compelling and inspiring vision
- Experience methods for creating such visions
- Articulate vision in ways that engage and motivate teams

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This section is foundational for everything else in the module
- Vision provides the "North Star" for autonomous decision-making
- We'll explore what makes a vision compelling and practice crafting one
- Timing: 45 minutes total (20 min content, 15 min activity, 10 min discussion)
-->

---

## Why Vision Matters

**In VUCA environments, vision provides:**
- **Inspiration:** Motivates teams to stretch beyond current capabilities
- **Engagement:** Creates emotional connection to the work
- **Commitment:** Builds dedication even when challenges arise
- **Cohesion:** Aligns diverse teams around common direction

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Remember VUCA from Module 1: Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity
- In turbulent environments, vision is the anchor
- Without vision, teams default to short-term, reactive thinking
- With vision, teams can make decisions autonomously aligned to larger purpose
- Source: ICAgile learning outcomes
- Ask: "Think about a time you were part of team with compelling vision vs one without - what was different?"
-->

---

## What Vision Is (and Isn't)

**Vision IS:**
- A clear picture of a desired future state
- Inspiring and aspirational
- A guide for decision-making
- Focused on the "what" (what we want to create)

**Vision is NOT:**
- Mission (why we exist)
- Strategy (how we'll get there)
- Goals (specific measurable targets)
- Tactics (specific actions)

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Many organizations confuse these terms
- Vision: Where are we going? What does success look like?
- Mission: Why do we exist? What's our fundamental purpose?
- Strategy: How will we achieve the vision? What's our approach?
- Goals: What specific, measurable outcomes mark progress?
- Example: Amazon vision "To be Earth's most customer-centric company" vs their strategy (logistics, tech, marketplace)
-->

---

## Characteristics of Compelling Visions

**C.R.I.S.P.**

- **C**risp: Clear, specific, easy to visualize
- **R**ealistic: Believable given resources and context
- **I**nspiring: Energizes and motivates people
- **S**pecific: Concrete enough to guide decisions
- **P**urposeful: Connected to meaningful outcomes

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Use CRISP as a checklist for evaluating vision statements
- Crisp: "Be the best" is vague; "Transform how HR delivers value through data-driven insights" is crisp
- Realistic: Should stretch capabilities but not feel impossible
- Inspiring: Should make people excited to come to work
- Specific: Should help answer "should we do this project?" questions
- Purposeful: Should connect to impact that matters
- We'll use these criteria in our practice exercise
-->

---

## Vision Enables Decentralized Decision-Making

**Traditional:** Leadership makes all strategic decisions → slow, bottlenecked

**With Clear Vision:** Teams make decisions aligned to vision → fast, scalable

**The Connection:**
Vision acts as guardrails for autonomous teams

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This is critical for business agility
- When vision is clear and shared, you can trust teams to make good decisions
- Teams ask: "Does this move us toward our vision?" instead of "What does my boss want?"
- Example: If marketing vision is "Create experiences customers love to share," team can decide whether to invest in viral campaign feature
- Clarity = Speed
- Ask: "What decisions could your team make faster if you had clearer vision?"
-->

---

## Example: Marketing Department Vision

**Weak:**
"Be a world-class marketing organization"

**Strong:**
"Create marketing experiences so valuable that customers seek them out, share them enthusiastically, and see us as trusted partners in their success"

**Why it's better:**
✓ Specific behaviors (seek out, share, trust)
✓ Customer-focused
✓ Guides decisions (does this create value customers want to share?)
✓ Inspires (aim for partner status, not just vendor)

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Notice how the strong version gives clear decision criteria
- "Should we do this email blast?" → "Would customers seek this out and share it?"
- "Should we sponsor this event?" → "Will this build trusted partner perception?"
- The weak version could mean anything - doesn't guide action
- Invite participants to critique: what makes it compelling to them?
- Time check: 15 minutes elapsed, 30 to go
-->

---

## Example: HR Transformation Vision

**Weak:**
"Modernize HR to support business growth"

**Strong:**
"Transform HR from administrative function to strategic partner that unlocks human potential, enabling every employee to do their best work and every leader to build high-performing teams"

**Why it's better:**
✓ Defines the shift (administrative → strategic partner)
✓ Specific outcomes (unlock potential, best work, high-performing teams)
✓ Employee and leader focused
✓ Inspiring purpose (human potential)

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Notice the "from-to" structure helps clarify the transformation
- "Strategic partner" is more specific than "modern"
- "Unlock human potential" connects to meaningful purpose
- Clear enough to guide priorities: data analytics over process compliance
- Ask: "How does this help HR decide what projects to prioritize?"
-->

---

## Example: Finance Vision

**Weak:**
"Provide accurate financial reporting and control"

**Strong:**
"Become the trusted insight partner that empowers business leaders to make faster, smarter decisions through real-time financial clarity and predictive analytics"

**Why it's better:**
✓ Relationship change (control → partner)
✓ Business outcome focus (faster, smarter decisions)
✓ Specific capabilities (real-time, predictive)
✓ Shifts from backward-looking to forward-looking

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Traditional finance = scorekeepers looking backward
- Agile finance = strategic partners enabling speed
- "Faster, smarter decisions" is outcome that business leaders care about
- "Real-time" and "predictive" suggest specific capability investments
- Ask: "Finance professionals in room - how would this change your prioritization?"
-->

---

## Reflection: Your Current Vision

**Think about your team or function:**

1. Do you have a clear, written vision?
2. If yes, rate it on CRISP criteria (1-5 each)
3. If no, what makes it hard to articulate?
4. How would a clearer vision change day-to-day decisions?

**Turn to a partner and share** (3 minutes)

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Give them 2 minutes to think individually first
- Then 3 minutes to discuss in pairs
- Walk around and listen to conversations
- This surfaces current state and makes the need real
- Don't skip this - makes the next exercise more meaningful
- Time check: 20 minutes elapsed, 25 to go
-->

---

## Activity: Vision Crafting (15 minutes)

**Choose a scenario:**
- Your team/function
- A project you're leading
- An initiative you want to start

**Draft a compelling vision using this template:**

*"[Transform/Create/Become] [from what to what], enabling [who] to [do what / achieve what], through [key capabilities or approaches]"*

**Work individually for 10 minutes, then share in small groups**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Provide template on slide and in handout
- Encourage specific, concrete language
- Remind them of CRISP criteria
- 10 minutes individual work (silent)
- 5 minutes small group sharing (3-4 people)
- Ask them to give peer feedback using CRISP checklist
- This is practice, not perfection - drafts are fine
- Supplies: Worksheets with template and CRISP checklist
- Time check: will use 15 minutes, leaving 10 for debrief
-->

---

## Debrief: Vision Crafting

**Volunteers share:**
- Your vision statement
- What was challenging?
- What made it compelling?

**Group discussion:**
- How would this vision guide your decisions?
- What would you need to communicate it effectively?
- How do you get team buy-in?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Get 2-3 volunteers to share their vision statements
- Invite group to give feedback using CRISP criteria
- Common challenges: Being specific vs vague, balancing inspiring vs realistic
- Key insight: The process of crafting forces clarity
- Connect to next section: Vision sets direction, customer empathy ensures it's the right direction
- Time check: 45 minutes total for Section 1
- TRANSITION: "Now we have compelling visions - but how do we ensure they create real value for customers?"
-->

---

# Section 2: Customer Empathy and Value Creation

**Duration:** 45 minutes

---

## Section 2 Learning Objectives

- Explain the values, principles, tools and techniques needed to develop empathy
- Apply tools: persona maps, customer journey maps, empathy maps, value propositions
- Recognize that everyone between you and the customer is an internal customer

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This section is about grounding strategy in customer reality
- Vision without customer empathy = building what you think they want, not what they need
- We'll introduce 4 core tools and practice with one
- Timing: 25 min concepts + 15 min activity + 5 min debrief
-->

---

## Why Customer Empathy Matters

**Value is subjective**
- What's valuable to one customer may not be to another
- Value depends on context, timing, needs, and alternatives
- We can't define value - only customers can

**Customer focus is a core capability for business agility**
- Enables fast feedback and learning
- Reduces waste (building wrong things)
- Builds loyalty and advocacy

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Source: ICAgile learning outcomes emphasize value is subjective
- Example: Same hotel room - business traveler values wifi, vacationer values pool, parent values adjoining rooms
- Traditional approach: We define value based on features we build
- Agile approach: We discover value by understanding customers
- Ask: "When have you built something you thought was valuable but customers didn't use it?"
- This section gives tools to prevent that
-->

---

## What is Customer Empathy?

**Customer Empathy:**
Deep understanding of customer's context, needs, pains, and aspirations

**It's not:**
- Surveys and statistics (those are data)
- Assuming you know because you're like them
- Focus groups where people say what they think you want to hear

**It is:**
- Direct observation and conversation
- Understanding their world, not just your product
- Seeing through their eyes

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Empathy = "feeling with" not "feeling for" (sympathy)
- Requires getting out of your own perspective
- Example: Watching someone use your website vs asking "do you like our website?"
- Empathy precedes innovation - can't solve problems you don't understand
- Ask: "Who are your customers - internal or external?"
-->

---

## Internal vs External Customers

**External Customers:**
End users who consume your product/service

**Internal Customers:**
Everyone between you and the end customer who depends on your work

**Key Insight:**
If you're not directly serving external customers, your internal customers are just as important

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Most people in this room likely have internal customers (other departments)
- HR customers: Employees and leaders
- Finance customers: Business unit leaders, executives
- Marketing customers: Might be both external and internal
- IT customers: Internal users of systems
- Your internal customers' success contributes to external customer success
- "We all win together" - value chain thinking
- Ask: "Who depends on your work? List 3 internal customers."
-->

---

## Customer Empathy Tools Overview

**Four Core Tools:**

1. **Persona Maps** - Who is the customer?
2. **Empathy Maps** - What do they think, feel, say, do?
3. **Customer Journey Maps** - What's their experience over time?
4. **Value Proposition Canvas** - What value do we promise?

**We'll explore each, then practice with Empathy Maps**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- These are complementary tools, not alternatives
- Persona: Understand who (demographics, goals, context)
- Empathy Map: Understand inner world (thoughts, feelings, motivations)
- Journey Map: Understand experience over time (touchpoints, emotions, pain points)
- Value Proposition: Align what we offer to what they need
- All four together create comprehensive understanding
- Time check: 10 minutes into Section 2
-->

---

## Tool 1: Persona Maps

**Purpose:** Create semi-fictional representation of ideal customer

**Key Elements:**
- Name, role, demographics
- Goals and motivations
- Pain points and frustrations
- Context and constraints
- How they make decisions

**Example (HR):**
"Sarah, Department Manager - Needs to hire quickly but struggles with slow approval processes. Values efficiency and candidate experience. Makes decisions based on time-to-hire metrics."

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Personas make abstract "users" concrete and memorable
- "What would Sarah think?" is easier than "what would users think?"
- Should be based on research, not assumptions
- Include photo and quote to make them feel real
- Keep 2-3 primary personas, not 20
- Use in meetings: "Does this serve Sarah's needs?"
- Template will be in take-home materials
-->

---

## Tool 2: Empathy Maps

**Purpose:** Understand what customer thinks, feels, says, does

**Four Quadrants:**
- **Think & Feel:** Inner world, worries, aspirations
- **See:** What they observe in environment
- **Say & Do:** Public behavior and statements
- **Hear:** What others tell them

**Bottom Section:**
- **Pains:** Frustrations, obstacles, fears
- **Gains:** Wants, needs, success measures

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Created by XPLANE, popularized by Strategyzer
- Helps get inside customer's head
- Think/Feel vs Say/Do reveals gaps (what they won't admit publicly)
- See and Hear provide context that shapes their perspective
- Pains and Gains summarize what matters most
- Best done based on actual interviews or observations
- We'll practice this tool in our activity
- Visual: Show empathy map template
-->

---

## Tool 3: Customer Journey Maps

**Purpose:** Visualize customer's experience over time

**Elements:**
- **Stages:** Phases of experience (Awareness → Consideration → Purchase → Use → Advocacy)
- **Touchpoints:** Where they interact with you
- **Emotions:** How they feel at each stage (emotional curve)
- **Pain Points:** Where things go wrong
- **Opportunities:** Where you could improve

**Example (HR):** New employee onboarding journey from job offer to 90-day mark

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Journey maps reveal disconnects between stages
- Example: Marketing creates excitement, but onboarding is disappointing
- Emotional curve is key - where do they get frustrated or delighted?
- Often reveals that pain points are in transitions between stages
- Example: HR onboarding gap between offer acceptance and first day (lost excitement)
- Should include both what IS happening and what you WANT to happen
- Cross-functional tool - reveals handoff problems
- Template in materials
-->

---

## Tool 4: Value Proposition Canvas

**Purpose:** Align what you offer with what customers need

**Customer Side (Profile):**
- Customer jobs (tasks they want to accomplish)
- Pains (obstacles and frustrations)
- Gains (desired outcomes and benefits)

**Value Side (Map):**
- Products/Services (what you offer)
- Pain relievers (how you address pains)
- Gain creators (how you create gains)

**Success = Fit between profile and map**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Created by Strategyzer (Alex Osterwalder)
- Left side: Understand customer deeply
- Right side: Design value proposition to match
- Fit = your pain relievers match their pains, your gain creators match their gains
- Common mistake: Starting with what we offer instead of what they need
- Example: Customer job "evaluate vendor options quickly" → your pain reliever "free trial, no credit card needed"
- Tool helps test: Are we solving problems they actually have?
- Template available in Business Model Generation book and online
-->

---

## Quick Example: Finance Team Empathy Map

**Scenario:** Business unit leader as internal customer of finance

**Think & Feel:**
"I need budget answers fast to make decisions, but finance takes weeks"

**See:**
Competitors moving faster, opportunities slipping away

**Say & Do:**
Asks for budget updates repeatedly, workarounds finance with assumptions

**Hear:**
CEO asking for faster decision-making, finance saying "we need complete data"

**Pains:** Slow responses, lack of predictive insights, feeling controlled not supported

**Gains:** Speed, predictive analytics, trusted partnership

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This is what empathy reveals - the gap between finance and business leader perspectives
- Business leader sees finance as bottleneck, not partner
- Finance might see themselves as ensuring accuracy and control
- Empathy map helps finance understand the customer experience
- Connect to vision: "trusted insight partner for faster decisions" addresses these pains/gains
- This is preparation for our practice activity
- Time check: 20 minutes into section 2
-->

---

## Activity: Create an Empathy Map (15 minutes)

**Choose a customer (internal or external):**
- Someone whose work depends on what you deliver
- Someone you want to serve better
- Someone for an initiative you're planning

**Complete an Empathy Map:**
1. Think & Feel
2. See
3. Say & Do
4. Hear
5. Pains
6. Gains

**Work in pairs** - 10 minutes creating, 5 minutes sharing with another pair

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Provide empathy map templates (paper or Miro)
- Encourage choosing real customer they know well
- If they don't have direct customer knowledge, work from best understanding
- Pairs collaborate - one person's customer, both contribute ideas
- Then share with another pair for feedback
- Listen for: Are pains/gains specific enough? Do think/feel reveal insights?
- Supplies: Empathy map templates, markers, sticky notes
- Time: 10 min working + 5 min sharing = 15 minutes
- Time check: Will complete at 35 minutes into section
-->

---

## Debrief: Empathy Mapping

**What did you discover?**
- Surprises about your customer?
- Gaps in your knowledge?
- New ideas for how to serve them better?

**How might this change your approach?**

**Connection to business agility:**
Customer empathy enables fast experimentation - you test with real needs, not assumptions

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Get 2-3 pairs to share their maps and insights
- Common discoveries: "I realized I don't know what they're hearing from others"
- Common gaps: "I've never observed them actually using what I deliver"
- Action: What would you need to do to fill knowledge gaps? (Interviews, observation, etc.)
- Connect to agility: Empathy → better hypotheses → faster learning
- Time check: 45 minutes total for Section 2
- TRANSITION: "Now we understand our customers and have compelling vision - how do we plan the journey from here to there?"
-->

---

# Section 3: Envisioning the Future State

**Duration:** 30 minutes

---

## Section 3 Learning Objectives

- Envision the future state of business agility
- Learn ways to look backwards from that future to craft a compelling path
- Gain understanding of why and how to use this activity with teams

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This section introduces backcasting methodology
- Complements vision (what) with pathway (how to get there)
- Shorter section (30 min) - introduces concept, we'll apply it in Foundations Sprint
- Timing: 15 min concepts + 10 min guided exercise + 5 min debrief
-->

---

## Traditional Planning vs Backcasting

**Traditional (Forecasting):**
Start with current state → project forward → see where you end up

**Backcasting:**
Define desired future state → work backward → identify path to get there

**Why backcasting is powerful:**
- More creative (not constrained by current limitations)
- More motivating (inspiring future pulls you forward)
- More strategic (focused on destination, not just incremental progress)

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Forecasting asks "Where are current trends taking us?"
- Backcasting asks "Where do we want to be?" then "What needs to change?"
- Example: Forecasting = "We'll have 10% more automation by next year"
- Backcasting = "In 3 years we're fully automated, working backwards what capabilities do we need?"
- Backcasting especially valuable in complex, uncertain environments
- Source: ICAgile learning outcomes
- Ask: "Which approach do you typically use in your planning?"
-->

---

## How Backcasting Works

**Step 1:** Envision the Future State
- What does success look like in 2-3 years?
- What's different about how we work?
- What value are we creating?

**Step 2:** Identify Capabilities Needed
- What skills, behaviors, practices enable that future?
- What systems, tools, processes?
- What culture and mindset?

**Step 3:** Map the Path
- Working backward, what are the major milestones?
- What's the sequence? What depends on what?
- What can we start now?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Step 1 is where vision comes in - specific, compelling picture
- Step 2 is capability gap analysis - what do we need that we don't have?
- Step 3 is roadmap creation - turning aspiration into plan
- Key: Don't need to plan every detail, just major capability shifts
- Example: Future state "real-time financial insights" → need "automated data pipeline" → need "data architecture redesign" → can start "current state data audit"
- Makes big visions feel achievable by breaking them down
- Time check: 7 minutes into Section 3
-->

---

## Example: Marketing Agility Future State

**Future State (2 years):**
"Marketing operates with 2-week iteration cycles, testing 10+ experiments per month, with real-time performance dashboards and autonomous team decision-making"

**Capabilities Needed:**
- Rapid experimentation platform and processes
- Data analytics infrastructure
- Team skills in hypothesis testing
- Decision-making authority and trust
- Agile marketing framework adoption

**Path Backward:**
Q4 2027: Full autonomous operations
Q2 2027: All teams running experiments
Q4 2026: Platform launched, 2 pilot teams
Q2 2026: Skills training, platform selection
Q1 2026 (Now): Current state assessment, vision alignment

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Notice how specific the future state is - measurable, observable
- Capabilities span tech (platform), skills (testing), process (framework), culture (trust)
- Working backward creates sequence: trust before autonomy, platform before experiments
- Quarterly milestones, not daily tasks - strategic not tactical
- This becomes the roadmap that guides prioritization
- Ask: "What would need to be in place for your team to operate more agilely?"
-->

---

## Example: HR Transformation Future State

**Future State (3 years):**
"HR delivers predictive insights on talent needs 6 months ahead, employees rate HR as their most valuable partner (90%+ satisfaction), leaders use HR data in every strategic decision"

**Capabilities Needed:**
- People analytics platform and expertise
- Predictive modeling skills
- Trusted advisor relationships with leaders
- Employee-centric service design
- Proactive vs reactive operating model

**Path Backward:**
2028: Predictive operations fully embedded
2027: Analytics platform live, pilot programs
2026: Skills development, relationship building, platform build
2025 (Now): Assess current state, build vision alignment, secure investment

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Notice this addresses both technical (platform, analytics) and relational (trusted advisor)
- "90%+ satisfaction" is specific measure that can be tracked
- Path shows major shifts: reactive → proactive, administrative → strategic
- Working backward reveals: Can't jump to predictive without platform and skills
- Roadmap helps communicate to stakeholders: "Here's why we need these investments"
- This is how you connect inspiring vision to practical steps
-->

---

## Guided Exercise: Future State Visualization (10 minutes)

**Close your eyes and imagine...**

It's 2 years from now. Your team or function has successfully adopted business agility.

- What does a typical day look like?
- How do decisions get made differently?
- What are you delivering that you couldn't before?
- How do customers (internal or external) describe working with you?
- What capabilities made this possible?

**Open your eyes - write down your future state** (5 minutes)

**Pair share:** Your future state and 2-3 key capabilities needed (5 minutes)

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Create quiet, reflective environment for visualization
- Speak slowly, leave pauses
- Guide them: "Be specific. What do you see? What do you hear?"
- After visualization, give 5 minutes to capture in writing
- Encourage detail: not just "we're agile" but "we run 2-week sprints"
- Then 5 minutes to share with partner and discuss capabilities
- Partners help each other identify capability gaps
- This surfaces personal vision that can inform team vision
- Time check: Will use 10 minutes, 5 remaining for debrief
-->

---

## Debrief: From Vision to Reality

**Key Insights:**
- Future state must be specific enough to plan backward from
- Capabilities include tech, skills, process, AND culture
- The gap between current and future reveals the work

**Application:**
- Use backcasting for strategic planning
- Use with teams to create shared roadmap
- Revisit regularly as future state evolves

**Connection to next section:**
Foundations Sprint is one method to create strategic clarity and focus

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Ask: "What capabilities appeared in multiple people's future states?"
- Common themes: autonomy, speed, data, customer focus
- Key insight: You can't build future state all at once - sequencing matters
- Backcasting reveals dependencies: trust before autonomy, skills before tools
- This ties to business agility: iterative approach to transformation
- Time check: 30 minutes for Section 3 complete
- TRANSITION: "We're now ready for our major activity - Foundations Sprint, which brings together vision, customer focus, and strategic clarity"
- Break recommendation: 10-minute break before the 60-minute Foundation Sprint activity
-->

---

## Break (10 minutes)

**When we return:**
Foundations Sprint Activity (60 minutes)

**Get ready:**
- Form groups of 4-6
- Bring a project, initiative, or challenge to work on
- Be ready for fast-paced, structured strategic thinking

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This is good break point - 1.5 hours complete, 1.5 hours to go
- During break, set up for Foundation Sprint activity
- Prepare: Miro boards or poster templates
- Prepare: Sticky notes, markers, voting dots
- Consider room setup: tables for groups of 4-6
- When they return, groups should be ready to dive in
- Activity is time-boxed and fast-paced - energy is important
-->

---

# Section 4: Activity - Foundations Sprint

**Duration:** 60 minutes

---

## Section 4 Overview

**What is Foundations Sprint?**
A time-boxed process to create strategic clarity through three phases:
1. **The Basics** - Customer, problem, competition
2. **Differentiation** - How you'll stand out
3. **Magic Lenses** - How to evaluate approaches

**Created by:** Jake Knapp (Google Meet, Design Sprint) and John Zeratsky (Google Ventures)

**Full version:** 10 hours over 2 days
**Today:** 60-minute abbreviated version focused on core insights

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Foundation Sprint source: Lenny's Podcast episode with Jake Knapp and JZ
- Used with startups but highly applicable to any strategic initiative
- Helps teams get clarity on what matters most
- Core insight: Slow down to think clearly, so you can move faster long-term
- Today we'll focus on key exercises that create strategic focus
- Output: Clear understanding of who you serve, how you differentiate, and how to evaluate options
- Time: 60 minutes including intro and debrief
-->

---

## Why Foundations Sprint Matters

**The Problem:**
"Most teams rush to build without clarity on basics, creating generic solutions that don't stand out"

**The Solution:**
Slow down for strategic thinking → create radical clarity → move faster with confidence

**Key Insight from Jake Knapp:**
"AI makes building fast, but products become generic. Slowing down for deep thinking makes you faster long-term."

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Source: Video timestamp 0:40-1:01
- Common pattern: Teams skip strategy, jump to execution, realize later it's wrong
- Foundation Sprint prevents this by front-loading strategic clarity
- 10 hours seems slow, but saves months of building wrong thing
- For us: 60 minutes of strategic thinking will clarify next steps
- Ask: "How many of you have worked on projects where you later realized you were building the wrong thing?"
- Foundation Sprint prevents that
-->

---

## Foundation Sprint: Three Phases

**Phase 1: The Basics (20 min today)**
- Who's your customer?
- What problem are you solving?
- What's the competition?
- What are your advantages?

**Phase 2: Differentiation (25 min today)**
- How will you stand out?
- What's your 2x2 positioning?
- What makes you radically different?

**Phase 3: Magic Lenses (10 min today)**
- How do you evaluate options?
- What lens matters most?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- These three phases build on each other
- Basics = foundation and warm-up
- Differentiation = heart of the sprint, where most value comes from
- Magic Lenses = decision-making framework
- Together they create "founding hypothesis" - your strategic thesis to test
- Original sprint: ~3 hours basics, ~4 hours differentiation, ~2 hours lenses, ~1 hour synthesis
- Today: Abbreviated but covers key concepts
- Let's dive into each phase
-->

## How We'll Work: "Work Alone Together"

**The Method:**
1. **Silent individual work** - Everyone writes their own ideas (no talking!)
2. **Vote** - Everyone places dots on ideas they like
3. **Decider** - One person makes final call

**Why it works:**
- Gets diverse perspectives (not groupthink)
- Moves through decisions quickly
- Saves decision-making energy
- Introverts and extroverts equally heard

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Source: Video timestamp 21:17-22:14
- This is key facilitation method throughout Foundation Sprint
- Silence is critical - prevents loudest voice from dominating
- Voting surfaces patterns without long debate
- Decider role (usually team lead or sponsor) breaks ties and maintains momentum
- Example: "Who's the customer?" - everyone writes their answer silently, then we vote, then decider confirms
- Feels awkward at first but creates better decisions faster
- We'll practice this throughout activity
- Time check: 10 minutes into Section 4, ready to start activity
-->

---

## Activity Setup: Form Groups and Choose Scenario

**Group Size:** 4-6 people

**Choose a scenario to work on:**
- A new initiative or project starting soon
- An existing product/service you want to improve
- A strategic challenge or opportunity you're facing
- A transformation you're planning

**Designate a Decider:** Usually team lead, project sponsor, or most senior person

**You'll need:** Sticky notes, markers, voting dots, template worksheets

**Let's begin!**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Give groups 2-3 minutes to form and choose scenario
- Encourage real scenarios they care about - more engagement
- Remind: Choose something with clear customer and competition
- Decider role is important - should be someone with decision authority
- Check: Does each group have supplies?
- Distribute: Basics worksheet, Differentiation worksheet, 2x2 chart template
- Facilitator should circulate during activity to keep groups on time
- Time check: Setup should take 3-5 minutes max
-->

---

## Phase 1: The Basics (20 minutes)

**Answer these questions using "Work Alone Together":**

1. Who is your most important customer? (3 min)
2. What problem are you solving for them? (3 min)
3. Who is the competition? (3 min)
4. How do they solve it today? (Alternatives/workarounds) (3 min)
5. What are YOUR advantages? (Insight, motivation, special capabilities) (5 min)

**For each question:**
- 2 min silent writing → 30 sec voting → 30 sec decider confirms

**START NOW!**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Time each question strictly - use timer
- Announce: "Silent writing - 2 minutes, go!"
- Then: "Put dots on your top choices - 30 seconds!"
- Then: "Decider, what's your call?"
- Keep energy high and pace fast
- Circulate: Are groups being specific enough?
- Common issue: "Customer" too broad → push for specific segment
- Source: Video 14:54-15:41 - "Almost embarrassingly simple but teams have different answers"
- By end you should have clear 1-sentence answers to each question
- Advantages are foundation for differentiation - capture all ideas
- Time check: 20 minutes for full Basics phase
-->

---

## Phase 2: Differentiation - Introduction (2 minutes)

**Now the heart of the Foundation Sprint:**

"People's default is to ignore new things. You need RADICAL DIFFERENTIATION to break through."
— Jake Knapp

**Your challenge:**
Create a clear promise from customer's perspective that sets you apart from all alternatives

**Key requirement:**
You must be able to deliver AND customers must care

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Source: Video 29:46-30:48
- This is most important phase - where real strategic clarity comes from
- Differentiation must be:
  1. From customer's perspective (not "we use AI" but "you get answers 10x faster")
  2. Specific and measurable
  3. Something you can actually deliver
  4. Something customers actually value (not just cool to you)
- We'll use two tools: Classic differentiators + Custom differentiators
- Then create 2x2 chart to visualize positioning
- Time: 25 minutes for full differentiation phase
-->

---

## Classic Differentiators Checklist (5 minutes)

**Rate yourself and competitors on these continuums (1-5):**

- Fast → Slow
- Smart → Not so smart
- Easy to use → Hard to use
- Free → Expensive
- Focused → One size fits all
- Simple → Complicated
- Integrated → Siloed

**Which 1-2 can you be RADICALLY better at?**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Source: Video 31:31-32:14, 39:07-39:34
- Give groups 5 minutes to score themselves and 2-3 main competitors
- Key: Be honest - you don't need to win on everything
- Look for where you can be notably better (4-5 points different)
- Example: Competitor is 2/5 on "fast", you could be 5/5 → good differentiator
- Caution: Don't claim 5/5 on everything - not credible
- Push for realistic self-assessment
- Source: Video 43:49-44:22 "Don't need to be best on ALL differentiators"
- Circle the 1-2 where you have biggest advantage
- Supplies: Classic differentiators worksheet
-->

---

## Custom Differentiators (10 minutes)

**Now create YOUR OWN differentiators specific to your context**

**Format:** [Good state] → [Bad state]

**Examples from video:**
- Networked → Siloed
- Painless growth → Labor-intensive growth
- Works out of the box → Requires setup
- Mobile first → Desktop only

**Your turn:** Create 3-5 custom differentiators and score them

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Source: Video 32:08-32:48, 46:17-47:43
- Custom differentiators are often more powerful than classic ones
- They "create new lens on reality for customers"
- Think: What continuum would show you in best light?
- Example (HR): "Proactive talent insights → Reactive hiring support"
- Example (Finance): "Real-time predictive → Monthly backward-looking"
- Work alone together: 5 min brainstorm differentiators, 3 min score, 2 min vote on top 2
- Look for differentiators that:
  1. Customers care about (not just cool to you)
  2. You can credibly claim advantage
  3. Competition can't easily copy
- This creates your unique strategic positioning
-->

---

## Create Your 2x2 Differentiation Chart (10 minutes)

**Choose your top 2 differentiators as axes:**
- Horizontal axis: Differentiator #1
- Vertical axis: Differentiator #2

**Plot competitors:**
- Where does each alternative land?
- Goal: Put all competitors in "Loserville" (the L-shaped bottom-left area)
- Put yourself in top-right

**Test:**
- Can you actually deliver on this positioning?
- Do customers care about these dimensions?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Source: Video 31:02-34:46
- "Loserville" = the three quadrants that aren't top-right (video 34:02)
- This is the iconic 2x2 positioning chart
- Reference: Steve Jobs iPhone intro slide - smartphone vs not smart, easy vs hard
- Example: If your axes are "Fast vs Slow" and "Personalized vs Generic":
  - Top-right: Fast + Personalized (you)
  - Competitors might be: Fast + Generic, Slow + Personalized, Slow + Generic
- Key test: "If we view the world through these two dimensions, do we win?"
- If competitors also in top-right, choose different differentiators
- Supplies: 2x2 chart template
- Have groups draw chart on poster or Miro board
- Time: 10 minutes to create and refine
-->

---

## Phase 3: Magic Lenses Introduction (10 minutes)

**The Challenge:**
Multiple approaches could solve the same problem for the same customer - how do you choose?

**The Solution:**
Evaluate options through different "lenses"

**Five Lenses:**
1. **Customer:** Easy to use vs perfect solution
2. **Pragmatic:** Cheap and fast to market
3. **Growth:** Reach most customers, easy to adopt
4. **Money:** Long-term value, biggest audience
5. **Differentiation:** Delivers on your positioning

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Source: Video 54:54-56:27
- This phase helps when you have multiple paths forward
- Example: Should we build mobile app or web app first?
- Each lens reveals different priorities
- Customer lens: Mobile might be easier to use
- Pragmatic lens: Web might be faster to market
- Growth lens: Mobile might reach more people
- Money lens: Web might have better long-term value
- Differentiation lens: Which delivers on our promise?
- Use lenses to score options, then discuss which lens matters most for this decision
- Time: We'll do quick intro and demo, groups can apply to their scenarios
-->

---

## Magic Lenses Quick Exercise

**Think of 2-3 different approaches to your challenge**

**Score each approach (1-5) on each lens:**
- Customer lens
- Pragmatic lens
- Growth lens
- Money lens
- Differentiation lens

**Discuss: Which lens matters most for this decision?**

**What does that suggest about your approach?**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Give groups 7-8 minutes for this exercise
- Example approaches (Marketing): Influencer campaign vs content marketing vs paid ads
- Example approaches (HR): Build internal tool vs buy external platform vs hybrid
- Scoring reveals trade-offs
- Key question: Which lens is most important given your context and goals?
- If differentiation is "fast", then pragmatic lens (cheap/fast) might align
- If differentiation is "perfect solution", customer lens matters most
- This creates framework for decision-making going forward
- No single right answer - clarity on priorities is the goal
- Supplies: Magic lenses worksheet
-->

---

## Debrief: Foundations Sprint (5 minutes)

**Each group shares (30 seconds each):**
- Your customer and problem
- Your 2x2 positioning (top 2 differentiators)
- One key insight from the exercise

**Full group discussion:**
- What was most valuable?
- What was most challenging?
- How will you use this in your work?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Give each group 30 seconds to share highlights
- Keep fast - not full presentations
- Listen for: Clarity, specificity, differentiation
- Common valuable insights: "We didn't agree on customer," "Differentiation we chose surprised us"
- Common challenges: "Hard to be specific," "Wanted to be great at everything"
- Key learning: Strategic clarity requires hard choices
- Application: Use Basics to align teams, use 2x2 for positioning, use lenses for decisions
- This is abbreviated version - full 10-hour sprint goes much deeper
- Provide: Link to full Foundation Sprint resources for those interested
- Time check: 60 minutes total for activity
-->

---

## Foundations Sprint: Key Takeaways

**Basics:** Clarity on customer, problem, competition, advantages
**Differentiation:** Radical clarity on how you're different (2x2 chart)
**Magic Lenses:** Framework for evaluating approaches

**The Founding Hypothesis Format:**
"If we solve [this problem] for [this customer] with [this approach], we think they'll choose us over competitors because of [differentiator 1] and [differentiator 2]"

**Next Steps:**
Test your hypothesis with customers!

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Source: Founding hypothesis format from video 16:35-16:47
- This one sentence captures entire strategic thesis
- Example: "If we solve slow decision-making for business unit leaders with real-time predictive analytics, they'll choose us over traditional finance because we're FAST and PREDICTIVE"
- The hypothesis is meant to be tested, not just stated
- Business agility connection: Create hypothesis → test → learn → adapt
- Encourage participants to complete founding hypothesis after session
- Provide: Template for founding hypothesis in take-home materials
- Time check: Ready for module summary
-->

# Module 3 Summary

---

## What We Covered

**Section 1:** Compelling Vision and Clarity of Purpose
- Vision provides direction for autonomous teams
- CRISP criteria for effective visions

**Section 2:** Customer Empathy and Value Creation
- Four core tools: Personas, empathy maps, journey maps, value propositions
- Internal customers matter too

**Section 3:** Envisioning the Future State
- Backcasting from desired future
- Capability gap analysis

**Section 4:** Foundations Sprint Activity
- Basics, Differentiation, Magic Lenses
- Created strategic clarity

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Review each section briefly
- Ask: "What's one thing you'll apply from this module?"
- Connect the sections: Vision + Customer Empathy + Future State + Strategic Focus = Business Agility
- These tools enable autonomous, customer-focused teams to move fast
- All tie back to business agility foundations from Module 1-2
-->

---

## Key Insights

1. **Vision without customer empathy = building the wrong thing clearly**
2. **Strategic clarity is what enables speed** (autonomy without vision = chaos)
3. **Differentiation must be radical, not incremental**
4. **Work alone together creates better decisions faster**
5. **Backcasting makes inspiring futures feel achievable**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- These are integrative insights across the module
- #1: You need both vision AND customer focus
- #2: This is core agility principle - clarity enables autonomy
- #3: From Foundation Sprint - "good enough" doesn't break through
- #4: Facilitation method that produces better results
- #5: Planning technique that bridges aspiration and action
- Ask: "Which insight resonates most with you?"
-->

## Appendix: Founding Hypothesis Template

**If we solve** [SPECIFIC PROBLEM]

**for** [SPECIFIC CUSTOMER]

**with** [SPECIFIC APPROACH]

**we think they'll choose us over** [SPECIFIC ALTERNATIVES]

**because of** [DIFFERENTIATOR 1] **and** [DIFFERENTIATOR 2]

---

**Example:**
If we solve **slow, reactive financial reporting** for **business unit leaders** with **real-time predictive analytics dashboards**, we think they'll choose us over **traditional monthly reports** because we're **10x FASTER** and **PREDICTIVE not reactive**.

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Mad libs format makes it simple to complete
- Must be specific - no generic language
- This becomes your strategic hypothesis to test
- Share with stakeholders to align on direction
- Use to guide prioritization: Does this work support our hypothesis?
- Revisit quarterly: Is hypothesis still valid based on what we've learned?
- Format source: Video 16:35-16:47
