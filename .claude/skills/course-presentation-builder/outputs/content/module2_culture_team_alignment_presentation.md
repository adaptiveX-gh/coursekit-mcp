## Why This Module Matters

**The Foundation of Business Agility:**

- Business agility starts with **mindset**, not methodology
- Self-organizing teams need **alignment** and **trust**
- Understanding **complexity** changes how we lead and decide
- **Mental models** shape what we see as possible

> "Culture eats strategy for breakfast." - Peter Drucker

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Set context: Agile isn't just tools, it's ways of thinking
- Personal transformation precedes organizational transformation
- This is difficult work but highest ROI
- Connect to their challenges: What mental models constrain you?
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

# Section 1

## Developing a Growth Mindset

**45 minutes**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Foundation for all other mindset work
- Start with self-assessment
- Create safe space for vulnerability
- Connect to business agility explicitly
-->

---

## Section 1 Learning Objectives

**You will be able to:**

- Describe attributes of growth mindset vs fixed mindset
- Explain why growth mindset is paramount for business agility
- Reframe failure as learning opportunity
- Apply growth mindset principles to business challenges

**Key Question:** How does our mindset enable or constrain our ability to be agile?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Estimated section time: 45 minutes total
- 10 min intro, 15 min content, 10 min exercise, 10 min discussion
- Very interactive - not lecture-heavy
-->

---

## Quick Self-Assessment

**Think about a recent challenge or setback at work.**

Which thoughts came up for you?

**Option A:**
- "I'm not good at this"
- "This isn't my strength"
- "Some people are just better at this"

**Option B:**
- "I haven't mastered this *yet*"
- "What can I learn from this?"
- "How can I improve my approach?"

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Have participants reflect silently (2 min)
- No need to share publicly - just notice their patterns
- Option A = Fixed Mindset, Option B = Growth Mindset
- We ALL have both - this is not about judgment
-->

---

## Growth vs Fixed Mindset

**Fixed Mindset:**
- Talents and abilities are static
- Failure reflects on inherent capability
- Avoids challenges that might reveal limitations
- Threatened by others' success

**Growth Mindset:**
- Talents and abilities can be developed
- Failure is opportunity to learn
- Embraces challenges as chance to grow
- Inspired by others' success

*Source: Carol Dweck, Mindset: The New Psychology of Success*

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Carol Dweck's research at Stanford
- Based on decades of research
- Both mindsets are present in all of us in different domains
- The power is in NOTICING which one is active
-->

---

## Why Growth Mindset for Business Agility?

**Business Agility Requires:**

✓ **Continuous Learning** - Responding to change means learning constantly

✓ **Experimentation** - Testing hypotheses means accepting some will fail

✓ **Adaptation** - Pivoting requires believing we can develop new capabilities

✓ **Resilience** - Thriving in VUCA requires recovering from setbacks

**Without growth mindset:** Change feels threatening, not opportunistic

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Connect directly to ICAgile learning outcomes
- VUCA = Volatility, Uncertainty, Complexity, Ambiguity
- Growth mindset is FOUNDATION for all agile practices
- Example: Sprint retrospectives only work if we can learn from "failures"
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## The Power of "Yet"

**Fixed Mindset:**
- "I can't do this"
- "I'm not creative"
- "I don't understand agile"
- "Our organization can't change"

**Growth Mindset:**
- "I can't do this **yet**"
- "I'm not creative **yet**"
- "I don't understand agile **yet**"
- "Our organization hasn't changed **yet**"

**One word changes everything.**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- The word "yet" implies possibility and time
- Opens door to learning and development
- Try it yourself - notice the feeling difference
- Model this in how you facilitate: "You haven't mastered this yet"
-->

---

## Reframing Failure

**In Agile, We:**

- Run **experiments** (not just execute plans)
- Conduct **retrospectives** (learning from what didn't work)
- Create **MVPs** (minimum viable products that may not be perfect)
- **Pivot** based on learning (admitting initial assumptions were wrong)

**All require treating "failure" as data, not disaster**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Agile methodologies ASSUME some things won't work
- That's why we work in iterations
- Fail fast = learn fast = be agile
- Contrast with traditional: failure is hidden, blamed, avoided
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## Enterprise Examples

**Marketing:**
- Campaign didn't hit targets → **What did we learn about our audience?**

**HR:**
- New onboarding process has issues → **How can we iterate and improve?**

**Finance:**
- Forecast was off → **What factors did we miss? How can our model evolve?**

**Sales:**
- Lost a deal → **What insights can inform our next approach?**

**The growth mindset question: "What did we learn?"**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Use examples relevant to your audience
- Invite participants to share their examples
- Notice: We're not celebrating failure, we're mining it for learning
- This is psychological safety in action
-->

---

## Activity: Growth Mindset Reflection

**Individual Reflection (5 minutes):**

1. Identify one area where you tend toward **fixed mindset** in your work
2. Write one "yet" statement that reframes it with growth mindset
3. What would you need to believe/do to develop that capability?

**Pair Share (5 minutes):**
- Share with partner
- Listen for themes and patterns

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Give full 5 minutes for reflection - this is hard work
- Circulate if in-person, monitor breakout rooms if virtual
- Emphasize: No judgment, just noticing
- Prepare 2-3 people to share in large group (optional)
- Total time: 10 minutes
-->

---

## Key Takeaways: Growth Mindset

**Remember:**

1. **Growth mindset** = Belief that abilities can be developed through effort and learning
2. Essential foundation for **business agility** and continuous improvement
3. **Reframe failure** as learning opportunity, not personal limitation
4. **"Yet"** is a powerful word that opens possibilities

**Coming up:** How our mental models and blind spots shape what we see

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Reinforce main concepts
- Address questions
- Connect to next section: Growth mindset helps us examine our mental models
- Estimated time: 3 minutes
-->

<!-- SECTION 2: MENTAL MODELS AND BLIND SPOTS -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->

# Section 2

## Mental Models, Blind Spots, and Sense Making

**45 minutes**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Builds on growth mindset foundation
- More challenging content - requires self-examination
- Use examples and frameworks to make abstract concrete
- Goal: Awareness of how we filter reality
-->

---

## Section 2 Learning Objectives

**You will be able to:**

- Recognize that blind spots and mental biases exist
- Explain how mental models shape perceptions and beliefs
- Apply techniques to examine personal mental models
- Identify mental models that may constrain business agility

**Key Question:** What am I not seeing because of how I see?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Estimated section time: 45 minutes
- This is deep work - go slowly
- Lots of "aha" moments happen here
- Prepare for discomfort - that's where growth happens
-->

---

## What Are Mental Models?

**Mental Models** are internal representations of how we think the world works.

They are:
- **Filtered** from our experiences, beliefs, and values
- **Invisible** to us (like water to a fish)
- **Powerful** in shaping what we perceive and how we respond
- **Changeable** (with awareness and intention)

> "We don't see things as they are; we see them as we are." - Anaïs Nin

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Everyone has mental models - they help us make sense of complexity
- Problem: We mistake our model for reality itself
- Example: "The way we do things here" = mental model, not universal truth
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## The Invisible Made Visible

**Example Mental Models in Business:**

- "Annual budgets are necessary for financial control"
- "Face-to-face meetings are more effective than virtual"
- "We need detailed plans before we can start"
- "Marketing is about advertising and promotion"
- "Change must come from the top"
- "People won't work hard without close supervision"

**Question: Which of these are *truths* vs *mental models*?**

Answer: **All are mental models**, not universal truths

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Pause after each one - let it land
- Some will feel like facts, not models
- That's the point - we mistake our models for reality
- Invite discussion: "What challenges these models?"
- Estimated time: 7 minutes
-->

---

## How Mental Models Form

**The Process:**

1. **Experience** something in the world
2. **Select** certain data (ignore most)
3. **Add meaning** based on beliefs and culture
4. **Draw conclusions**
5. **Form beliefs** about how things work
6. **Take actions** based on those beliefs
7. **Filter future experiences** through those beliefs

**Result:** We see what we expect to see

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This is the Ladder of Inference (Peter Senge, Chris Argyris)
- We climb the ladder so fast we don't notice
- Our beliefs reinforce themselves
- Question: How do we challenge our own thinking?
-->

---

## The Ladder of Inference

![The Ladder of Inference](images/ladder_of_inference.png)
<!-- TODO: Create diagram showing:
- Bottom: Observable data
- Select data
- Add meanings
- Make assumptions
- Draw conclusions
- Adopt beliefs
- Take actions
- Top: Reinforcing loop back to selective observation
-->

**We climb this ladder in milliseconds**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Walk through diagram step by step
- Key insight: We select data based on existing beliefs
- This creates self-reinforcing loops
- To break the loop: Go back down the ladder
- Question our conclusions, examine our data selection
- Estimated time: 8 minutes
-->

---

## Blind Spots

**Blind Spot** = Area where our mental model prevents us from seeing reality accurately

**Common Organizational Blind Spots:**

- What worked in the past will work in the future
- Our competition is who we've always competed with
- Our customers want what they've always wanted
- Our strengths are immune to disruption
- Change is the exception, not the norm

**In VUCA world, blind spots are dangerous**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Blind spots aren't stupidity - they're natural
- The danger is thinking we don't have them
- Examples: Blockbuster, Kodak, Nokia
- They couldn't see what their mental models filtered out
- Question: What might your organization not be seeing?
-->

---

## Traditional Management Mental Models

**ICAgile Learning Outcome:**
"Traditional management models may no longer serve us, but actually constrain our effectiveness"

**Examples:**

- **Command & Control** → Assumes people won't perform without direction
- **Annual Planning** → Assumes future is predictable
- **Functional Silos** → Assumes specialization optimizes efficiency
- **Individual Performance Reviews** → Assumes individual output is separable from team

**In complex, fast-changing environments, these models constrain agility**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- These worked in stable, predictable environments
- They create rigidity in VUCA world
- Not about blame - these were logical at the time
- Question: What models does your organization hold?
- Estimated time: 7 minutes
-->

---

## How to Examine Mental Models

**Techniques:**

1. **Notice your language**: "Always," "Never," "Can't," "Must"
2. **Question assumptions**: "What if the opposite were true?"
3. **Seek disconfirming data**: "What evidence contradicts this?"
4. **Slow down decisions**: "What am I assuming here?"
5. **Invite diverse perspectives**: "Who sees this differently?"

**The goal:** **Awareness**, not perfection

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Small practices that build awareness
- Start with curiosity, not judgment
- You can't see your own blind spots alone
- Diversity of perspective is essential
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## Activity: Mental Model Mapping

**Individual Work (7 minutes):**

Think about a challenge or decision you're facing. Answer:

1. **What do I believe is true about this situation?**
2. **What data/experiences led me to this belief?**
3. **What might I be filtering out or not seeing?**
4. **What would someone with a different background notice?**

**Small Group Discussion (8 minutes):**
- Share one insight
- Help each other identify assumptions

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This is advanced self-reflection
- Circulate and support if needed
- No "right answers" - just awareness-building
- Some may struggle - that's normal
- Reinforce: This is practice, not mastery
- Total time: 15 minutes
-->

---

## Key Takeaways: Mental Models

**Remember:**

1. **Mental models** filter our perception - we see through them, not around them
2. **Blind spots** are natural - everyone has them
3. **Awareness** is the first step to changing limiting models
4. **Slow down thinking** to examine assumptions
5. **Diverse perspectives** help us see our blind spots

**Coming up:** Understanding complexity and how it changes our approach

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This is hard work - acknowledge that
- Growth mindset applies here: We're developing awareness
- Mental models will come up throughout the course
- Estimated time: 3 minutes
-->

<!-- SECTION 3: COMPLEXITY AND BUSINESS AGILITY -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->

# Section 3

## Complexity and Business Agility

**30 minutes**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Shift from internal (mindset) to external (environment)
- Introduce frameworks - Cynefin most important
- Goal: Different contexts require different approaches
- Complexity requires agility
-->

---

## Section 3 Learning Objectives

**You will be able to:**

- Distinguish between complicated and complex contexts
- Apply the Cynefin framework to classify problems
- Explain why traditional planning doesn't work in complexity
- Recognize when to use different approaches

**Key Question:** Is this a complicated problem or a complex one?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Estimated section time: 30 minutes
- Faster pace than previous sections
- Focus on Cynefin as practical tool
- Theory of Constraints and Systems Dynamics are references
-->

---

## Organizations as Complex Systems

**ICAgile Learning Outcome:**
"When we recognize our organization as a complex system, traditional management models may actually constrain our effectiveness"

**Complex System** = Many independent agents interacting in unpredictable ways

**Characteristics:**
- Emergent properties
- Non-linear cause and effect
- Sensitive to initial conditions
- Unpredictable outcomes

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Organizations aren't machines, they're ecosystems
- You can't "control" them, only influence
- Prediction is limited in complex systems
- This is why agile approaches work better
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## Complicated vs Complex

**Complicated:**
- Many parts, but predictable
- Experts can diagnose and solve
- Cause and effect are discoverable
- Best practices exist
- **Example:** Building a car engine

**Complex:**
- Unpredictable interactions
- Experts can't predict outcomes
- Cause and effect only clear in hindsight
- Emergent practices emerge
- **Example:** Raising a child

**Different contexts need different approaches**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This distinction is critical
- We often treat complex problems as merely complicated
- Results: Over-planning, micromanagement, frustration
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## The Cynefin Framework

![Cynefin Framework](images/cynefin_framework.png)
<!-- TODO: Create diagram showing 5 domains:
- Clear (Simple): Best Practices, Sense-Categorize-Respond
- Complicated: Good Practices, Sense-Analyze-Respond
- Complex: Emergent Practices, Probe-Sense-Respond
- Chaotic: Novel Practices, Act-Sense-Respond
- Confused: Center - don't know which domain
-->

**Five domains, five approaches**
*Created by Dave Snowden*

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Cynefin = Welsh word meaning "habitat"
- Helps categorize problems to choose appropriate response
- Most powerful framework for business agility
- We'll focus on Complex domain - that's where agility shines
- Estimated time: 3 minutes
-->

---

## The Five Domains

**Clear (formerly Simple):**
- Obvious cause-effect
- **Approach:** Best practices, standard operating procedures
- **Example:** Expense reimbursement process

**Complicated:**
- Expert diagnosis needed
- **Approach:** Good practices, analysis
- **Example:** Technical system optimization

**Complex:**
- Cause-effect only clear in hindsight
- **Approach:** Experiment, probe, sense, respond
- **Example:** Culture change, market positioning

**Chaotic:**
- No clear cause-effect
- **Approach:** Act immediately to establish order
- **Example:** Crisis response

**Confused:** Don't know which domain you're in

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Walk through each domain
- Key: Approach must match domain
- Using "best practices" in complexity fails
- Complex is where agile excels
- Estimated time: 8 minutes
-->

---

## Enterprise Examples

**Marketing:**
- **Complicated:** Campaign measurement and analytics
- **Complex:** Brand positioning in changing market

**HR:**
- **Clear:** Benefits enrollment process
- **Complex:** Culture transformation, engagement

**Finance:**
- **Complicated:** Financial modeling
- **Complex:** Strategic investment in uncertain market

**Sales:**
- **Complicated:** Sales process optimization
- **Complex:** Relationship building, adapting to buyer needs

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Invite participants to classify their challenges
- Most strategic work is Complex
- That's why detailed planning doesn't work
- Need to experiment and adapt
- Discussion: What's complex in your work?
-->

---

## Why Complexity Requires Agility

**In Complex Domains:**

❌ **Detailed Planning** → World changes before plan executes
❌ **Best Practices** → What worked before may not work now
❌ **Expert Analysis** → Can't predict emergent outcomes

✓ **Experiments** → Safe-to-fail probes
✓ **Iteration** → Sense and respond cycles
✓ **Adaptation** → Pivot based on learning
✓ **Emergence** → Allow patterns to emerge

**Agility = The right approach for complexity**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This is why agile methodologies work
- Sprints, MVPs, retrospectives = probe-sense-respond
- Waterfall = designed for complicated, fails in complex
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## Quick Practice: Classification

**Classify these as Clear, Complicated, or Complex:**

1. Implementing new collaboration software
2. Improving employee engagement
3. Monthly financial close process
4. Entering a new market segment
5. Debugging a technical performance issue
6. Building trust in a team

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Do as quick poll/discussion
- Answers: 1-Complicated, 2-Complex, 3-Clear,
  4-Complex, 5-Complicated, 6-Complex
- Point: Most strategic challenges are Complex
- Estimated time: 4 minutes
-->

---

## Key Takeaways: Complexity

**Remember:**

1. **Complicated** ≠ **Complex** - different contexts need different approaches
2. **Cynefin Framework** helps classify and choose response
3. **Complex contexts** require experimentation, not detailed planning
4. **Business agility** is optimized for complexity
5. **Probe-sense-respond** rather than predict-plan-execute

**Coming up:** Managing unsolvable problems (polarities)

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Reinforce Cynefin as practical tool
- They can take this back and use immediately
- Link to agile practices in later modules
-->

---

<!-- ============================================================ -->
<!-- SECTION 4: MANAGING POLARITIES -->
<!-- ============================================================ -->

# Section 4

## Managing Polarities and Paradoxes

**30 minutes**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Shorter section but important concept
- Many recurring problems are polarities, not solvable problems
- Both/and mindset is advanced thinking
- Builds on earlier mental model work
-->

---

## Section 4 Learning Objectives

**You will be able to:**

- Distinguish polarities from traditional problems
- Apply polarity mapping to organizational tensions
- Practice both/and thinking vs either/or
- Manage ongoing tensions effectively

**Key Question:** Is this a problem to solve or a polarity to manage?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Estimated section time: 30 minutes
- Focus on identification and mapping
- Polarity Management by Barry Johnson
-->

---

## What Is a Polarity?

**Polarity** = An interdependent pair that seems opposite but both are necessary

**Characteristics:**
- **Unsolvable** - choosing one pole creates problems
- **Ongoing** - requires continuous management
- **Interdependent** - both poles have upsides and downsides
- **Inevitable** - the tension will always exist

**Example:** Breathing in vs breathing out
- You need both
- Choosing one exclusively = death
- Continuous balancing required

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Barry Johnson's Polarity Management
- Not all problems are solvable
- Recognizing polarities saves wasted effort trying to "solve" them
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## Classic Business Polarities

**Common Organizational Tensions:**

- **Stability** ↔ **Change**
- **Individual** ↔ **Team**
- **Short-term** ↔ **Long-term**
- **Centralized** ↔ **Decentralized**
- **Quality** ↔ **Speed**
- **Innovation** ↔ **Execution**

**Both poles are necessary - we must manage the tension**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Ask: Which sound familiar?
- Traditional thinking: Pick one (either/or)
- Polarity thinking: Optimize both (both/and)
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## Problem vs Polarity

**Problem:**
- **Solvable** - has an answer
- **Finite** - once solved, stays solved
- **Either/or** - choose the best option

**Example:** "Should we use Slack or Teams?"
→ Research, decide, implement, done

**Polarity:**
- **Unsolvable** - ongoing management
- **Infinite** - tension recurs
- **Both/and** - need both poles

**Example:** "Should we standardize or allow flexibility?"
→ Never "solved" - always balancing

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Key skill: Distinguishing which is which
- Treating polarity as problem = wasted effort
- Treating problem as polarity = indecision
- Estimated time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## Both/And vs Either/Or Thinking

**Either/Or (Traditional):**
- "We need to focus on efficiency **OR** innovation"
- "Teams should be autonomous **OR** aligned"
- "We must move fast **OR** ensure quality"

**Both/And (Polarity):**
- "We need to be efficient **AND** innovative"
- "Teams should be autonomous **AND** aligned"
- "We must move fast **AND** ensure quality"

**The word "and" changes everything**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Similar to "yet" from growth mindset
- Language shapes thinking
- Both/and is harder but more powerful
- Creates creative tension, not win-lose
- Estimated time: 3 minutes
-->

---

## Polarity Map Example

**Polarity:** Stability ↔ Change

**Upsides of Stability:**
- Predictability
- Efficiency
- Mastery

**Downsides of Stability:**
- Rigidity
- Stagnation
- Irrelevance

**Upsides of Change:**
- Adaptation
- Innovation
- Growth

**Downsides of Change:**
- Disruption
- Chaos
- Burnout

**Goal:** Maximize upsides, minimize downsides of BOTH

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Show how both poles have value
- Over-focusing on one pole brings its downsides
- Organizations oscillate: Too stable → Change initiative → Too chaotic → Stability initiative → repeat
- Managing polarity = staying in the upsides
- Estimated time: 7 minutes
-->

---

## Enterprise Polarity Examples

**Marketing:**
- Brand Consistency ↔ Innovation and Experimentation

**HR:**
- Employee Autonomy ↔ Organizational Alignment

**Finance:**
- Cost Control ↔ Investment in Growth

**Sales:**
- Relationship Building ↔ Transaction Efficiency

**All require both/and thinking**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Invite participants to identify polarities in their work
- Notice which pole their organization over-favors
- The neglected pole will create problems
- Managing = intentionally leveraging both
-->

---

## Activity: Identify a Polarity

**Individual Reflection (3 minutes):**
Identify a recurring tension in your work that might be a polarity

**Pair Discussion (5 minutes):**
1. Share your polarity
2. What are the upsides of each pole?
3. What happens when you over-focus on one?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This is quick introduction, not deep mapping
- Goal: Awareness that polarities exist
- Full polarity mapping could be separate workshop
- Listen for both/and language starting to emerge
- Total time: 8 minutes
-->

---

## Key Takeaways: Polarities

**Remember:**

1. **Polarities** are unsolvable - they require ongoing management
2. **Both/and thinking** vs either/or creates better solutions
3. **Classic organizational tensions** are often polarities
4. **Both poles have value** - goal is to optimize both
5. **Recognizing polarities** saves wasted "solving" effort

**Coming up:** Team Alignment Canvas Activity

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- This is advanced thinking - plant the seed
- They'll see polarities everywhere now
- Both/and mindset supports collaboration
- Estimated time: 2 minutes
-->

<!-- ============================================================ -->

# Section 5

## Activity: Team Alignment Canvas

**60 minutes total (30 min activity + 30 min debrief)**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- Shift from concepts to practice
- Hands-on team building activity
- Based on Board of Innovation tool
- Critical for self-organizing teams
- This is where everything comes together
-->

---

## Team Alignment Canvas Overview

**Purpose:**
Align teams on goals, skills, values, and ways of working BEFORE diving into projects

**Why It Matters:**
> "One of the main reasons that teams and innovations actually fail is because they don't actually have the right team, they don't have the right motivations."
> - Board of Innovation

**When to Use:**
- Project kick-off
- Team formation
- After scoping work
- When team dynamics feel misaligned

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- From video: Mike, Board of Innovation
- Tool goes hand-in-hand with scoping
- Used early in innovation process
- Goal: Ensure right team before starting work
- Estimated intro time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## The 5 Sections of the Canvas

**1. Goals (Team)** - Strategic goals: feasible, measurable, time-bound

**2. Individual Goals** - Personal learning objectives

**3. Roles & Skills** - What each person brings

**4. Values** - Core principles and what team stands for

**5. Roles & Activities** - Day-to-day operations and ways of working

**6. Purpose** - Higher purpose (emerges from above)

*Source: Team Alignment Canvas, Board of Innovation*

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- 6 sections but counted as 5 + purpose
- Purpose comes last - emerges from other sections
- Each section has specific prompts
- Progressive building toward clarity
-->

---

## Section 1: Team Goals

**Strategic Goals for This Team/Project**

**Should be:**
- **Feasible** - achievable with resources available
- **Measurable** - you'll know when you achieve them
- **Time-bound** - clear timeframe

**Example:**
"Launch new employee onboarding experience by Q2 that reduces time-to-productivity by 30%"

**Your Turn:** What are your team's strategic goals?

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- From video (0:55-1:11)
- Similar to scoping canvas
- Defines what success looks like
- Provides scope for the project
- Work together as team on this section
- Time: 5 minutes
-->

---

## Section 2: Individual Goals

**Personal Learning Objectives**

**It's not just about the team as a whole**

What do YOU want to learn or achieve personally through this work?

**Examples:**
- "Learn how to facilitate workshops"
- "Develop skills in data analysis"
- "Build network in marketing department"
- "Improve my presentation skills"

**Individual motivations matter for team success**

<!--
SPEAKER NOTES:
- From video (1:15-1:42)
