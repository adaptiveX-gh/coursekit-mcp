Hi, I'm Mike.
0:08
I'm a senior innovation consultant at Board of Innovation
0:11
and I help corporates move across design,
0:13
business and innovation
0:15
and help them through the process
0:16
and speeding up as we go along.
Team canvas
0:18
I gonna introduce you to the Team canvas.
0:21
This is another tool that is very useful
0:23
at the early stages of a project.
0:25
So it goes quite hand in hand with the scoping canvas
0:28
that you should have already completed or about to complete.
0:30
So this tool is split up into five different sections
0:34
and really the goal of this template
0:36
is to align the teams and the skills,
0:38
the values and the expectations to make sure again
0:41
that you all aligned have the same common vision
0:44
and that you're working together in an optimal way
0:46
before you go into the innovation process itself.
0:50
So how to use this template?
0:53
First of all you want to look at your goals as a team.
0:55
So think about a bit like you did in your scoping canvas.
0:59
What are the strategic goals that you're looking at?
1:01
and what does success look like
1:03
when you finally achieve this?
1:04
So have a good think about that as a team.
1:07
This should be feasible and they should be measurable
1:10
and they should be time bound.
1:11
So that will give you some again some scope for the project.
Individual goals
1:15
Next looking at the individual personal goals of the team.
1:20
Its just not about the team as a whole
1:22
but maybe there are some learning objectives
1:23
for individual team members as well.
1:25
So make sure you have think per person
1:28
which goals you are looking to achieve personally.
1:32
And really remember to have in mind,
1:33
this tool is designed to make sure
1:35
that you have the right team assembled.
1:37
So the more information you can have on the goals
1:39
on a team level and individual level the better.
1:42
And one of the main reasons that teams
1:45
and innovations actually fail is
1:46
because they don't actually have the right team,
1:48
they don't have the right motivations.
1:50
So make sure you get this right early on
1:52
in your innovation project.
Roles and skills
1:55
Next one is looking at the roles and the skills.
1:59
So think about what skills do you have again individually,
2:01
what are you bringing to the team,
2:03
what is your unique value as a team member
2:05
that you're bringing.
2:06
What are you specifically good at
2:07
and what can you contribute.
2:09
So think individually again, so write your name down
2:13
and write down what you're good at
2:15
and what value you're bringing to the team.
Values
2:18
Next on the list is your values,
2:20
so what do you stand for as a group.
2:22
It's important to try and think
2:24
not just in terms of execution of another project
2:27
but what values are underpinning what it is you're doing.
2:30
What are your guiding principles
2:32
and what is the core value of the team
2:35
and make sure you're all aligned on that.
2:36
So maybe it's being entrepreneurial
2:38
or maybe it's helping others, whatever it is
2:42
make sure you define it at the beginning of the project
2:45
because if you don't have alignment,
2:46
maybe you don't have the right team,
2:47
and that's really the goal of the tool itself.
Roles Activities
2:51
Then moving on to roles and activities,
2:53
so this is more on a operational project level,
2:56
so what are you gonna actually be doing as a team
2:58
day by day, week by week,
3:00
what kind of knowledge transfer moments do you want?
3:03
Maybe there's going to be some weekly stand up meetings,
3:07
maybe you're gonna use SLAP instead of email
3:09
to increase knowledge transfer between the team.
3:12
So what are you goin to do day to day
3:14
and how are you going to align the team on that.
3:17
So really this should used in a kick off moment.
3:20
So you've just started your project,
3:22
you've scoped the project and now you want to kick off it
3:26
and make sure you that you have the right team
3:27
and the right skills together.
Purpose
3:29
And then finally think about your purpose as a team.
3:32
Is there a higher purpose that you're doing this?
3:34
Is it just another project that you're executing?
3:36
Or do you have some kind of core belief
3:38
and purpose driving it.
3:41
In this case it may be in coming up with solutions
3:43
to bring value to millennials,
3:45
to help them live healthier lifestyles for instance.
3:48
But be very clear and concrete on that,
3:50
and the purpose should emerge once you've filled out
3:52
all the other different sections on the tool.
Conclusion
3:55
So again once you've used these tips and tricks,
3:58
it's really designed to help you figure out what skills
4:01
you might not have in your team
4:03
and to give you a moment to self reflect
4:07
and possibly even change team members as well.
4:09
You really need to make sure
4:10
you have a complementary set of skills,
4:12
maybe you have some duplicate skills,
4:14
again you can look at switching out other people
4:16
or getting them to agree to align on a different role
4:19
within the group.
4:20
But once you've done this you'll be
4:22
in a very strong position to really start
4:24
diving into your project
4:25
and going through the innovation process
4:27
with the right team.
4:29
