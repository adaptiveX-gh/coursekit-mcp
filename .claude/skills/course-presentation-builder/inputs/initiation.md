- Target audience: Marketing Professional, HR Professional, Finance Professional, Salesperson, Executive, Team Lead, Director, Manager


My preference is to have 5 modules for the course, such as an intro module, a culture/team alignment module that focuses on mindset, values and principles and we run the team alignment canvas activity.  a module on vision & strategy to help teams focus and we will run the foundations sprint activities of basics > differentiation > magic lenses.  A module on the concept of experimentation and test and learns and we run an activity around assumptions mapping and designing an experiment. A module on process frameworks such as scrum and Kanban, and we will run the design your Kanban flow activity.  In all cases we need to make sure that this is geared towards the enterprise business with various groups such as marketing, HR, or finance meaning it should be relevant content and applicable to the types of projects they would be working on.

- Duration 14 hours, 12 hours between the four modules (3 hrs each) + 1.5 hour for intro module and .5 for closing/outro.

For now, can we produce the content for module 1 and module 2?

Can you help me work through the workflow?
