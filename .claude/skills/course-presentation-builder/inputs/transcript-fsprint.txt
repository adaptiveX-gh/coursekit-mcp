We would have a conversation with  founders, you're saying like, "Gosh,   I'm almost embarrassed to ask this question,   but who exactly is your target customer?" And  three co-founders have three different answers.
0:09
After these hundreds of  teams that we've worked with,   we've seen that there's one failure mode,  which is they don't know what that set  
0:15
of basics are. Then there's this other  failure mode where they never test it. Let's talk about the Foundation Sprint. Walk us  
0:21
through the process. How does  it start? What are the steps? The very beginning of your project, we  recommend this kind of crazy idea that  
0:28
you clear your calendar. So the core team  come together for 10 hours roughly and go  
0:33
through a sequence of activities so that we  can make all of the key decisions together. I think a lot of people wonder as  they're hearing this is why don't  
0:40
I just build something and launch it and learn? One phenomenon we've seen when teams are building  things really quickly with AI is that the more  
0:47
AI-generated or assisted they are, the more  generic they tend to turn out. Put yourself in   a situation where you can slow down and do some  hard thinking, some deep thinking about what's  
0:56
actually going to make your product unique. Going  fast can actually slow you down in the long run.
1:01
Today my guests are Jake Knapp and John  Zeratsky. The framework that Jake and   John share in this conversation is basically  the missing manual for founders and product  
1:09
teams trying to refine and test their startup or  product idea. It's called the Foundation Sprint,   and it emerged out of the famous Design  Sprint, which Jake and JZ co-created,  
1:18
and also from working with over 300 teams,  building both new product at startups and   also with teams at larger companies like Google,  Microsoft, YouTube, Slack, Uber, and many more. 
1:28
They published a book with this framework  at the beginning of this year called Click,   and the excerpt from that book that dives  into this framework is one of my most popular  
1:36
posts of all time and is one of the rare  non-AI posts amongst the top post rankings.  In this conversation, make sure to get your  pencils out because we go through exactly how  
1:44
to execute this two-day sprint, where at the end  of it you have a very clear hypothesis that your  
1:50
entire team is aligned around that clarifies  what you're building, who you're building for,   how it differentiates from competitors, and how to  quickly test it with real potential customers. The  
1:58
two days that you invest in a sprint might be the  highest ROI days in the history of your product,   and I highly encourage you to do this if  you're in the process of baking an idea.

I bring you Jake Knapp and John Zeratsky. This episode is brought to you by Brex,  
2:30
the financial stack used by one in every three US  venture-backed startups. Brex knows that nearly  
2:36
40% of startups fail because they run out of cash,  so they built a banking experience that focuses  
2:42
on helping founders get more from every dollar.  It's a stark difference from traditional banking   options that leave a startup's cash sitting  idle while chipping away at it with fees. To  
2:52
help founders protect cash and extend runway,  Brex combined the best things about checking,  
2:57
Treasury, and FDIC insurance in one powerhouse  account. You can send and receive money  
3:03
worldwide at lightning speed, you can get 20x the  standard FDIC protection through program banks,  
3:09
and you can earn industry-leading yield from  your first dollar while still being able to   access your funds anytime. To learn more,  check out Brex at brex.com/banking-solutions.

That's brex.com/banking-solutions. Many of you're building AI products, which  
3:27
is why I am very excited to chat with Brandon  Foo, founder and CEO of Paragon. Hey, Brandon.
3:33
Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having me. So integrations have become a big  deal for AI products. Why is that?
3:40
Integrations are mission critical  for AI for two reasons. First,   AI products need contacts from their customers  business data, such as Google Drive files,  
3:48
Slack messages, or CRM records. Second, for AI  products to automate work on behalf of users,  
3:54
AI agents need to be able to take action  across these different third-party tools. So where does Paragon fit into all of this?
4:00
Well, these integrations are a pain to  build, and that's why Paragon provides   an embedded platform that enables engineers  to ship these product integrations in just  
4:09
days instead of months across every use case  from RAG data ingestion to agentic actions.
4:15
And I know from firsthand experience   that maintenance is even harder than  just building it for the first time.
4:20
Exactly. We believe product teams should focus  engineering efforts and competitive advantages,   not integrations. That's why  companies like You.com, AI21,  
4:29
and hundreds of others use Paragon to  accelerate their integration strategy. If you want to avoid wasting months  of engineering on integrations that  
4:36
your customers need, check out  Paragon at useparagon.com/lenny. 
Origins of the Design Sprint
4:45
Jake and JZ, thank you so much for  being here and welcome to the podcast. Hey, Lenny. Thanks for having us.
4:51
Yeah, thanks so much for having us  on again. This is always a treat. This is going to be a very tactical conversation.  We're going to be going through how to actually  
4:59
execute a Foundation Sprint. And the reason  that I'm excited to do this is you guys shared  
5:05
an excerpt from your book where you initially  shared this whole concept. It's called Click.   You shared this in my newsletter and I  was just looking at it, and that excerpt,  
5:13
that post is amongst the top 10 most popular posts  of all time in my newsletter, which is especially  
5:20
special because it's not an AI-oriented, it's one  of the few non-AI posts that are near the top 10,  
5:26
which just tells me how valuable this is to  people. And consistently it has sat there, it   hasn't been usurped, it just continues to climb. So I'm really excited to just have a conversation  
5:35
where we share actually how to do this.  Let me just start with the beginning,   just a little backstory on how the Foundation  Sprint came to be. I know it emerged out of  
5:45
the now very famous Design Sprint, which  you guys also developed. So just give us   a very brief overview of just how this came  to be, this idea of this Foundation Sprint.
5:54
Well, maybe I'll start by talking about the  Design Sprint part because it is essential   to understanding the Foundation Sprint.  And the Design Sprint first developed,  
6:03
I had been working at the beginning of my career  at Microsoft for a few years. Went to Google,   which is like 2007, 2008, 2009, and was working on  the Gmail team, was working on some projects that  
6:15
were just executing well, delivering, shipping.  But I had this other project, a side project that  
6:22
had been going on for three years with a couple of  colleagues, was going nowhere, and it looked like  
6:29
their office was going to get shut down after  the financial crisis. They were in Stockholm.  I went there for a week. We cleared our calendars  for the week, and we created a prototype of this,  
6:38
this thing because we decided, look, we're  never going to get anywhere. We've tried   making the perfect pitch. We've tried to  make the ideal PRD, we've tried to show  
6:48
the ideal design, and we can't. Perfection is  not working. We're not able to align people,  
6:54
we're not able to get executive support for  this thing. We couldn't convince Larry and  
7:00
Sergey and Eric that they should fund this thing. In that week in Stockholm, we created a prototype  
7:06
instead. We decided you know what? Forget it.  We're just going to build something and put it   in people's hands, put it in our fellow Googlers  hands. And that prototype was what became Google  
7:17
Meet. It was this video conferencing tool  that you could use in the web browser. No big deal. Yeah, it was really cool. I mean, the outcome  of that, that's definitely probably the most  
7:25
productive week I've ever had. But the thing that  struck me at the time and in hindsight was, wow,  
7:32
it was so different to clear the calendar  for a week and have the entire focal point   of every person on the team be how do we create a  prototype that's so real, that works so well that  
7:44
people will think it's real, that they'll react  like it's real, that they'll want it? And we were  
7:49
in survival mode. We were trying to keep that  office from getting shut down. But the notion  
7:54
that maybe you could repeat that and recreate  that is what led me to create the Design Sprint. 
7:59
So for a couple of years at Google, I start  running these one-week programs with teams trying   to go at the beginning of a project from zero to a  prototype at the end that we can sort of evaluate,  
8:12
test. And then I went to go work at Google  Ventures. So separate, one of the Alphabet  
8:19
companies we're investing in startups. I meet John  Zeratsky and we start running these design sprints  
8:24
with, well, it turned out to be over the course  of five years, I don't know, couple hundred teams  
8:31
working in the early days with founders, in the  early days of their establishing the product for   the first time, trying to build it from zero  to one or launching a new marketing campaign,  
8:42
a new ad campaign, some big high-risk endeavor.  We'd get to work alongside them for a week.  And we ended up refining this process into a  recipe. So across five days, it's map, sketch,  
8:54
decide, prototype, and test, one big focal  point for each day. So at the end of the week,   you've got a tested prototype and you learn  are we on the right track or not? And that's  
9:05
the Design Sprint. That's kind of the  prologue, the backstory to this thing. 
9:11
And then after a few years at Google Ventures,  John and I left and eventually together with  
9:17
our co-founder, Eli Blee-Goldman,  we started our own venture firm,   Character Capital. And that's kind where  the story of the Foundation Sprint comes in.
9:25
Okay, awesome. JZ, anything you wanted to add? One of our goals, probably our biggest goal for  starting our own VC firm was that we wanted to be  
9:35
able to focus on just the kinds of companies and  the stage of company-building that was the most  
9:41
fun to us, but also was where we thought we  could have the biggest impact. And so for us,  
9:46
with our background as designers, that is the  early days, the first couple of months or the  
9:52
first year or two years of building a new  business. And at GV, sometimes we did that,  
9:57
but sometimes we were working with companies that  were already well established. And when we'd come   into those companies, they kind of knew what they  were doing. They knew what they stood for. They  
10:06
knew how they were different in the market and  how they were positioned. And so we could help   them answer these big questions and solve these  problems and test their prototypes with customers. 
10:15
But when we started investing in truly  pre-seed, sometimes inception stage,  
10:21
pre-product, pre-revenue, pre-everything  companies, there was this piece missing at  
10:26
the beginning of that process. So we'd run  design sprints and they would be helpful,   but oftentimes it felt like there was  a foundational element of that project  
10:36
that we didn't quite have our hands around.  And it was things like, what is the problem   you're solving and who's the ideal customer?  How are you different than what's in the  
10:46
market today? Who are your actual competitors? And there were these questions that just kept   coming up again and again that led us to say,  "Hey, we need to create a new sprint method,  
10:56
something that is really targeted for the very  beginning of these big new projects." And so  
11:01
that was what led us to create the Foundation  Sprint at Character Capital in 2021, 2022.
The Foundation Sprint process
11:08
Okay. Yeah, I was wondering the timeline  on this. What I love about stuff like this,   episodes like this is you guys have done so much  
11:15
work and done this so many times with  so many companies, so many founders,   and have learned what works and doesn't work. You  said hundreds of founders, hundreds of startups.
11:23
Yeah. And you've just spent so many hours  studying this, refining it, crafting it,   and now you're just here to share all the  answers, save us so much time. Just the ROI  
11:32
on this is incredible for us. So I appreciate you  guys doing this. Let's get into it. Let's talk   about the Foundation Sprint. Walk us through the  process. How does it start? What are the steps?
11:42
So specifically what we talk about with the  Foundation Sprint is it's at the very beginning   of your project. We recommend this kind of  crazy idea that you clear your schedule,  
11:54
you clear your calendar. So the core team, this  is the co-founders if it's a startup, if it's a   product team inside a larger organization, it's  whoever's in charge of product, it's whoever's in  
12:05
charge of engineering, it's whoever's in charge  of design, it whoever's in charge of marketing,   the core leadership team, they're going to come  together for, it's going to be 10 hours roughly,  
12:14
give or take. And during those 10 hours, we're  going to go through a sequence of activities,  
12:19
very highly scripted sequence of activities so  that we can make all of the key decisions together  
12:25
and identify the basics of the project, what's  going to differentiate us in the marketplace,  
12:30
and what's the best approach or implementation  path. All of those together form a hypothesis. 
12:36
And then we recommend, so you finish now,  that's your Foundation Sprint, you've got   your founding hypothesis. Once you've got that  founding hypothesis, then you're going to go and  
12:44
do design sprints, and we recommend you clear  the calendar for two to three weeks at least,   so you have the chance to be wrong about your  hypothesis. And we're going to run experiments.  
12:53
And again, the Design Sprint, highly scripted,  calendar clear, emails off, Slack is off. We're  
13:00
just focused on running through these sequence of  decisions, building prototypes, getting them in   front of customers, learning about a scorecard  that relates back to the founding hypothesis. 
13:09
So at the big picture, it's going to be anywhere  from 10 hours to three to four weeks. You're going  
13:16
to run this detailed script of activities with  your team with their calendars clear. And that's   crazy, and most people won't do it. But if you do  it, it confers upon you a huge advantage because  
13:27
now you've got information, you know whether or  not your product clicks with customers. And we've  
13:34
seen that be just such a tremendous signal  for is there going to be product market fit? Okay. That was really helpful.  The 10 hours is that specifically,  
13:41
that's the Foundation Sprint time box? That's the Foundation Sprint time box, yeah.  And it's give or take, right? You might go fast  
13:47
and be done in eight. And you might have a lot of  conversations and have a slightly larger team and   might take you 12. So we like to spread it out  over two days, do two four to six-hour blocks.
13:57
Okay. And then the three to four week-ish,  that's including the Design Sprint? That's the design sprints, yeah. Okay, awesome. One week per sprint.
14:02
Okay. This is incredible ROI on 10  hours of work. Basically over two days,   you get to have a much stronger sense of  whether your idea is any good. Yeah. Is  
14:14
that a simple way to describe it? You  just supercharge validating an idea? Exactly. Yeah, it's a chance to... In the  10 hours, it's a chance to get clarity  
14:25
about the core of your strategy, which is  something that teams will often go months   without really nailing down. And the  three to four weeks, that's a chance  
14:36
to run experiments and get confidence  you're actually building the right thing. Okay, let's talk about these two  days. How do you lay it out? How  
Phase one: The basics
14:45
do you approach it? What should someone do  if they want to actually try this at home? So there are three phases to the Foundation  Sprint. First phase is the basics,  
14:54
second phase is differentiation, and the third  phase is the approach to the project. So again,  
15:00
all three of those are going to come  together to create the founding hypothesis.  So the first phase, the basics, as I mentioned,  that's identifying who's your customer,  
15:10
what problem are you solving for the customer?  What's the competition for solving that problem?  
15:16
How do they solve it today? And what are  the alternatives? How else do people solve   this? What are the workarounds? Those are  really almost embarrassingly simple things  
15:25
to answer. But when we do this with a team  and everybody's answering, proposing their   answer to each question, we see everybody's got a  different perspective. And then when we lock in,  
15:34
the decision-maker on the team says, "Okay, it's  going to be this one, it's going to be this one,   it's going to be this one." Now we have clarity  and confidence that that's the right way to go. 
15:41
So we'll move forward from the basics into  differentiation and identify what are the things  
15:48
that can set us apart from those competitors? And  we're going to use the advantages we have. We're   going to use our insight, we're going to use  our motivation, we're going to use our special  
15:56
capabilities. These are things, again, people  are aware of these things, they're in tune to it,  
16:02
but we want to get super, super specific, and  we'll go into an example in a second, and I think  
16:08
that'll make it more clear exactly what we mean.  But going then from differentiation to saying,   "What are all of the different implementation  paths we could take here? Let's identify what  
16:16
those are, put a little detail behind them."  And then we have a structured path for people   to take so they can weigh that decision, but  move through really quickly. Commit to one,  
16:25
have a backup plan in case you end up feeling  like you need to pivot once you start sprinting   on it. And all of that together is going  to form this kind of Mad Libs sentence. 
16:35
If we solve this problem for this customer with  this approach, we think they're going to choose  
16:41
it over the competitors because of differentiator  one and differentiator two. And it's almost silly  
16:47
how simple this thing is, but really powerful  for founders to have that clarity about,  
16:54
okay, here it all is in one sentence. Now  let's go test and make sure this is true. Amazing. Let's look at an example.  That's a really good idea. I know  
Case study: Latchet
17:01
you brought some examples. You're going  to do some screen sharing. You're going   to pull it up. If you're watching on  YouTube, you'll be able to see it. Also,  
17:07
if you're watching on Spotify, you  can see the video. If you're on Apple   [inaudible 00:17:11]. But do your best to  describe what we're going to be looking at.
17:15
Yeah, so we're going to talk about this company  called Latchet first. This is the first company  
17:20
we'll talk about. And Latchet is a startup  who was in our last group of Character Labs,  
17:26
and we can go into Character Labs later on. But  essentially this is kind of an accelerator-like  
17:33
program that we run at Character Capital where we  invest in a group of companies at the same time,  
17:38
and we run them through that process that we were  just describing, where we start with a Foundation   Sprint, and then it's going to be a sequence  of three design sprints after that so that  
17:48
they're testing and refining that hypothesis.  And so it's a great time for them. These are   founders who have just started their companies.  They're kind of that pre-seed, very beginning,  
17:58
zero stage. And the progress you can see in those  three and a half, four weeks, it's phenomenal. 
18:06
So let's talk about Latchet. So Latchet,  a couple co-founders, Chris and James,  
18:12
who they had left Substack. They were engineers  leading up the growth team at Substack. And they  
18:20
wanted to build a product for artisans. So if you  imagine you're a jewelry maker, you're a painter,  
18:29
you're a woodworker, and you want to sell your  products outside of your immediate community,  
18:35
the physical place where you are, your physical  location, well, you can build a site on Shopify,  
18:41
but you still have to market it. If you do that,  you got to figure out how to reach those folks.   You can put your products on Etsy, but Etsy has  become quite commoditized. So you're going to be  
18:50
up against everybody everywhere, and it's going to  be very hard for you to build an identity there,  
18:56
to build a sense of who I am, what I'm all  about. And so what Chris and James thought  
19:02
was maybe we could use some of the techniques  and methods we used at Substack to help people  
19:09
find other newsletter writers through their  community, through recommendations they make  
19:14
and help out artisans in that way. Wouldn't  that be cool? So they were at that stage,   they had a few different ideas about what form  that might take, what that might look like when  
19:24
they joined Character Labs. And so that's kind of  the backdrop to this little quick story I'll tell.
19:30
And there's one really important thing  to emphasize about Chris and James that   Jake mentioned briefly, but I think is worth  repeating, which is that they're engineers,  
19:39
they are builders. Their instinct is to write  code, it's to build software. And they actually  
19:46
told us that they were excited but nervous  to come into Character Labs where we would  
19:52
be encouraging them not to write code right away,  to take this time to clarify the differentiation,  
20:00
the structure of what they're building, and to  validate that with customers before they went   all in on building a particular approach.  And I think you'll see in this example  
20:08
how while they were a little hesitant to do  that upfront, eventually they saw how much  
20:15
more valuable it was to work in this way versus  just diving right into building something. That's actually really helpful  context. And speaking of the Substack,  
20:23
Recommendations feature was one of the most  game-changing features for me with my newsletter  
20:29
because it basically supercharged  my growth. So I get why they'd be   so excited about bringing this learning to  other ideas and to their own startups. So  
20:37
thank you guys for doing that. And I'm even  more excited to see what they're building. Well, let's take a look. So this  board here that we're looking at,  
20:45
this is like their Miro board. So we've  got a big template. And whether you're   watching on YouTube or listening to this  episode, we'll talk about at the end how  
20:53
you can get access to this template, which  will kind of guide you through the process.  But what happens in this first step in the  Foundation Sprint, in the basics, as we said  
21:02
before, is that we're going through a sequence  of questions. Who's the most important customer,  
21:08
for example, is the first question, the very  first question that a team needs to answer. And   as we do that, just as an important side note,  we're using this tactic that we call work alone  
21:17
together. And specifically the note and vote  is this method where everyone's in silence,  
21:23
in this case both Chris and James, but if you have  a team of seven, it's all seven people be working   in silence, writing down their own answers to this  question, who's the most important customer or  
21:32
who are all the different kind of customers we  might consider? Writing down multiple answers.  And then once we've got those answers,  the team's going to vote on those. And  
21:42
then one person who's designated as the decider,  usually it's going to be the CEO of the startup,   but it could be in some cases, maybe it's the  chief product officer, whatever, however they  
21:53
decide to do it. But one person's going to say,  "Okay, this is our decision for now, and now we're   going to move on." And by doing this and using  silence and using structure and then having a  
22:02
designated decision-making process, we can move  through a lot of conversations very quickly and  
22:08
save some of that energy that it requires to make  the decisions that matter most. In this case,  
22:14
what we're really worried about on day one of  our Foundation Sprint is differentiation. So we  
22:19
don't want to spend too long on the basics. Anyway, we motor through customer problem,   the capability, the insight, the motivation  that the team has, those are all advantages,  
22:28
and who are the competition. And we get this sort  of one-page sheet, the basics, and it's going to  
22:34
have the answers to all those questions. Who's our  customer? In this case, artisans who want to sell   online, but they sort of find tech and marketing  to be hard. The problem is sales growth. If we  
22:47
jump down to the competition, their number one  competitor is Shopify, but Etsy is another way  
22:53
people approach this, as we mentioned. But there's  also in-person sales and art fairs or other ways   that people try to get at this problem. And  realistically, if you're delivering a solution,  
23:02
you need to stand out from all of those. And then there are advantages. We talked   about this key one, they built Substack's  network growth features, so they know how  
23:11
to do this thing. So now we've established the  basics. We're going to move on to differentiation.
23:18
Before you do that actually, let me ask you a  question here. Because I think people seeing   this could think, "Oh, this is like... I know  all this stuff, it's so obvious." It's like,  
23:26
"Okay, I get it. I have an idea, I don't need  to do this." Where do you find people most are   often surprised by something that emerges out of  this? Is one of these buckets often, wow, this is  
23:36
often not what you expected, or is it generally  a lot of surprises? What do you experience there?
23:41
I think the moment where you immediately  start to see value is when everyone on the  
23:47
team is writing down their answers to these  questions. And then people put their heads  
23:52
up and look at what everyone else has written  and they realize, "Oh, that's not what I said,"  
23:58
or "I didn't think of that one." Or, "Gosh." The actual concrete reality of going through  
24:05
with the team and being very transparent  and clear about how we're making decisions   too about each of these things, when that basic  sheet comes together and you see the specifics,  
24:16
the specifics are surprising, but it's also  familiar. We look at it and you say, "Yeah,   that all looks right, but I'm surprised by the  specifics. They're not what I would have written  
24:27
if I had written it down. I might've gotten two  of those things, two of the six items on there."  
24:32
And I think that's what's most surprising. And I  think it's also kind of a sense of relief that,  
24:38
okay, well, that's very reassuring that we have  clarity about that and we've made it concrete.
24:44
These activities that we do during the basics  are impactful for different reasons. I think that  
24:51
problem can be really interesting because  when teams sit down and think about it,   it is often less clear than they thought  what the actual problem is. Like, "Wait,  
25:02
what problem do our customers really  have that we're solving for them?"  I think competition can be sort of an aha  moment when they start to think beyond  
25:11
just what are the other startups in this  space? If this is an important problem,  
25:17
your customer's probably already solving  it somehow. It may be a workaround,   it may be an alternative, it may not be a  direct competitor, but if it's worth solving,  
25:25
they probably have some way of dealing with it  today. And what is that? And when you zoom out   and you look at that set of competitors,  it can be a little scary, but it is also  
25:35
an important moment for teams. And then I think that advantage   isn't necessarily immediately beneficial, but  it becomes really valuable when the teams are  
25:46
looking at differentiation, because startups  can't compete with big companies on scale or  
25:52
on having built-in distribution advantages or  having partnerships in place. So they really  
25:59
have to dig deep and figure out what can we do  that nobody else is capable of doing? And... ... and figure out what can we do that nobody  else is capable of doing? And so by taking time  
26:04
to sit down and do this almost unnatural act of  like, wait, why are we special? And when we're  
26:11
able to encourage teams to really think about  that, it sets them up really nicely for the   next step, which is differentiation.  Ideally, based on those advantages.
26:20
What I'm hearing is a lot of  the value here is also just   everyone has the answers in their  head in some way, but just seeing  
26:28
what everyone else is thinking and then  aligning on one is a lot of this value.
26:33
Yeah. It's like thinking deeply and quietly about  it yourself and then seeing what everybody else  
26:38
comes up with when they are able to also think  deeply and quietly about it. Then ideally,  
26:45
if they're working with us in character  labs, having somebody who's a bit external   to push them and say, try harder, dig deeper.  What really makes you special here? How are  
26:55
you really going to beat OpenAI? How are  you really going to beat Google at this. This whole idea of noting and voting and working  in silence. Such a recurring theme on this podcast  
27:04
of not doing brainstorms in large groups with  a lot of people. It feels like that's just dead   in every way. I just had this naming expert  on the podcast who names some of the biggest  
27:13
companies in the world, Pentium, Powerbook,  Sonos, Purcell, and that's their approach   is they used to do brainstorms. He's like, that  doesn't work. And now they just have small teams  
27:22
sitting quietly in a room working together on  ideas and then thinking on their own. So that's   such an interesting trend and I feel like IDEO  just created this whole, we need to brainstorm  
27:31
post-its, and then everyone's like, that's  not actually working. Let's stop doing that. 
27:36
The other thing that I feel as you're talking  through this, what I'm feeling this is for   founders, there's not a manual for starting a  company. It feels like this dark art of like,  
27:46
I guess I got to find product market fit.  And this idea, it feels like this is almost   a manual of everything you need to do to just  get the basics of is this even worth doing?
27:56
Yeah. And that's why we created it because  we still are investing in founders who are...  
28:04
They're incredibly talented and they're  smart and they have a background that is   going to give them an advantage in building  some particular product. But you're right,  
28:10
there's no manual and we were just kind of solving  our own problem and we believe in this so much  
28:18
and we see the ROI as being so great that this is  the first thing we do when we make an investment. 
28:24
We invest in a company and then we run a  foundation sprint with them right away. We   run more foundation sprints with startups than  we do design sprints at this point. And I don't  
28:34
think we can ever encapsulate every single thing  that you need to know or that you need to do to   start a company, but this is our best take at  what you should do in the early days to set  
28:46
yourself up for success and maximize the chances  that you're going to reach product market fit.
Phase two: Differentiation
28:52
Amazing. Okay, let's keep it going. So  we've done the basics. What comes next? Yeah, so we've done the basics and another  important thing that we've accomplished while  
29:00
going through the sequence of activities and  the basics is to boot up the right context into  
29:06
everyone's head so that we're ready for the main  event of this first day, which is differentiation.  
29:12
And I still have very firmly in my mind, I grew up  with a Mac plus computer and you'd put in the disk  
29:19
and the drive and you'd have to boot up the app  that you wanted to run. That's kind of the way our  
29:24
brains work. We have limited working memory and  we've got to have the right stuff in there when   we're going to make a big decision, when we're  going to think hard about a certain problem or  
29:35
question, it's important to have the right context  fresh at hand. So the basics is really the context  
29:40
for thinking about differentiation. And differentiation is the heart of  
29:46
what we're doing in the foundation sprint  because it goes without saying perhaps,  
29:52
but we like to say it. When you are making a new  product, people want to ignore it. People want to  
29:58
not pay attention to it, and if they do have to  pay attention to it, if it gets in their face,   they want to not try it because we just  are all bombarded by so many things and  
30:07
that's never been more true than it is now. And so we have defenses up to save calories in our  
30:14
brain. We don't want to engage. It's crucial then  that a product has a clear promise that it makes,  
30:21
and that promise is radically differentiated  from the alternatives and that that promise is  
30:28
strong enough that you'll try it and then that the  product delivers on that promise. And so when we  
30:33
talk about differentiation, we're saying, look, we  want you to be really clear on your promise, not  
30:39
the promise you're making to investors about this  technology and what's special about the technology   or what's special about the market opportunity,  but what the customer at the center. We've started  
30:48
the basics by talking about the customer and the  problem they have and the way they see the world.  And we want to talk about what you're going  to offer to the customer and how it's going  
30:57
to separate from the alternatives. And so in the  end of this next phase of the foundation sprint,  
31:02
we're going to have a two-by-two diagram that's  going to look like a business school one-on-one   diagram. And in fact, we often refer back to this  Steve Jobs iPhone introduction slide where he  
31:13
talks about the iPhone and he makes a joke about  it. This is a business school one-on-one diagram,   but it's really helpful to start developing  your product with this clarity about this  
31:22
is the promise we'll make to customers at  the end, and we're going to deliver on that   promise because we can test and prove that  in design sprints. So anyway, we start off,  
31:31
we talk about differentiators and we talk  about classic differentiators, fast to slow,  
31:37
smart to not so smart to borrow from the iPhone  slide, easy to use to hard to use, and so on. 
31:43
And we just start off and have the team, okay,  let's just score those up against the competition.   Put a sticky note on those continuums showing  where you think the product could be. And usually  
31:53
you'll do this and maybe you'll start to see  there are a couple places where we can stand out   on these classics. That's great. These classics  are easily understandable by any customer. We're  
32:04
all sort of familiar with these kinds of things.  So okay, that's great. Then we get into writing   custom differentiators. So we're going to write a  bunch of good things on one end, crummy opposite  
32:14
on the other end, and then we're going to score  those. And so for the Latchet story, we'll pick   up with Chris and James here. They've written,  well, we could really differentiate on networked  
32:27
versus siloed. Our approach is networked.  If you're using Shopify, you're siloed,   or maybe we can differentiate on painless business  growth versus labor-intensive business growth. 
32:37
So that might be the specific way we describe  the promise of our product. So after evaluating  
32:43
a bunch of these, writing a bunch of these, voting  on them quietly, and then the decider's going to  
32:48
say, all right, I don't want to choose a couple  of these and we're going to try them out. The   teams are going to... If you're running  a foundation sprint, you're going to try  
32:55
out a few differentiators. You're going to score  against your competitors. You're going to create   a scale and you're going to say, okay, let's  be honest. Let's be tough. Where do we really  
33:04
think we could stack up against the competitors  on this differentiator we've chosen in great  
33:09
detail plotting each company or product one at a  time. Okay, so you do that for one differentiator,  
33:16
you do it for another, you do it until you  feel like we've got two that are really strong,   and then you make that business school one-on-one  diagram. And so here's this one for says Lyric,  
33:26
they changed their name to Lachit,  so I'm going to edit that real time. I love this. So just rebrand.
33:32
Yeah. So Lachit's up here in the  top-right corner and we say, okay,   look, this is a good differentiation chart because  you've got this quadrant here, this quadrant here,  
33:42
this quadrant here, right? You've got the...  So you're in the top-right and you've- You've got to be in the top-right,  you got to be in the top-right.
33:49
You always have to be in the top-right. And if  you see those other three quadrants, the top-left,  
33:55
bottom-left, bottom-right, those form an L shape  and we call that Loserville. So we want to have a  
34:02
way of looking at the world that puts all of the  competitors into Loserville. And then we want to  
34:07
say, okay, if you can deliver on that and if that  promise is compelling to customers. So both those  
34:13
things have to be true. Can you deliver on it and  do customers care and believe that that matters  
34:19
to them? If both of those things are true, you  have a really compelling promise. You have the   possibility of a very successful product. So now  we've identified that and that becomes a core of  
34:30
our hypothesis. Is that differentiation  true? So that's the differentiation step.
34:39
Before you move on to the next step, is that  where you were going next? Just so I could take a- Yeah, yeah. Okay. Follow a couple of threads. This is so  awesome. There's just so much value here. Also,  
34:49
just this slide at the end here, folks  are watching YouTube. This is your deck   slide where you show your competitors  and how you're better than them all.
34:57
And actually I want to jump on that for a second  because we've all seen two by two. Hey Graham,  
35:03
right? There's a ton of these. They're all  over the place. And if you're anything like me,  
35:08
I just ignored these. I just thought these were  pretty much BS up until, well, whenever we started  
35:15
putting these foundations friends three or four  years ago. And I think the reason why usually   these two by two diagrams feel like this is  just consultant baloney. This is just like  
35:24
who... It's because maybe one person makes this  chart and they do it quickly because they needed  
35:32
to slide for the slide deck and the audience  they're considering, maybe it's investors.  
35:37
And so often these describe technology or they  describe the market opportunity, they don't talk   about the customer's perspective. And the other  thing is that they're not proven. There's no  
35:47
evidence behind the fact that these are true. So if they did happen to be about customer   perspective, it's unlikely that the whole team  would've weighed in on what those differentiators  
35:58
are, and it's very unlikely that we would've  tested and proven that matters and that we can  
36:03
deliver on it. And so if you do all of those  things and you do it at the beginning of the  
36:09
project, we think this has the potential,  when we've seen it becomes this, well,  
36:14
this guiding light, here's the North Star. We  need to deliver on this. This is what we have   to create. And that helps you make decisions all  the way through your product development cycle.
The importance of differentiation
36:24
Just to point people to justification  for why differentiation is so important,  
36:29
there's a couple of episodes that I did  that I'll point to in the show notes that  
36:34
just give you more context of why you  need to differentiate. So I spoke of   David Plastic who is this naming expert  that we just had on the podcast. His  
36:42
whole thing is when he's coming up with  a name for Sonos or Purcell or Windsor,   it has to differentiate. And he talks about this  in depth. So we'll point to that episode and this  
36:52
is just like if you're not convinced, why are we  spending so much time in differentiation? Also,   April Dunford who's like, I don't know, the god  of positioning. She has differentiation is such  
37:03
a core part of her approach to positioning. And  so there's just so much evidence to tell you  
37:08
that differentiation is a really important  step and element of successful companies. One of the things that I've noticed about these  topics that the basics we talked about already,  
37:19
differentiation, this notion of you need  a foundation for your project. It's a bit   more under the radar for people. I think it's a  bit harder for people to immediately see like,  
37:27
oh, we need this. We see the people who  react the strongest to this and have the   strongest immediate affinity to this  idea actually being start-up founders,  
37:37
people who are really sophisticated in this  challenge. Product managers who are at... We were  
37:45
invited in to speak at open AI and anthropic  about this, and we see the product people,   they're being like, oh my god, this is really  powerful. This is the kind of stuff we need. 
37:52
I think for a lot of folks though, it can sound  like this is just elementary, differentiation.  
37:58
Of course we need to differentiate. The problem  is that all of this stuff gets backgrounded. It's   something we've thought about a bit. We assume  we're on the same page, we assume we're going  
38:07
to deliver something, but then business as usual  happens, we build a product, we get kind of more  
38:12
interested in the technology and delivering that,  and we end up trying to sell it to customers at  
38:18
the end. We end up putting a coat of paint  on it with a marketing page or sales deck.   We haven't actually built from the beginning the  thing that we know is going to matter to people.
38:28
One of the most useful steps here that I haven't  seen before is just a starting place for how  
38:33
to even start thinking about differentiation.  Everyone's always probably thinking price and  
38:38
speed maybe. You guys have a really cool  just starting list that you showed here.   Anything more you can add here for  helping people start to think about  
38:44
ways to differentiate beyond the obvious price  and speed. And I don't know, a couple more.
38:50
So I'm just going to jump into another  startup here just so we can see what this   sheet looks like with scores on it. So  this is a startup called Mellow. Anyway,  
38:59
the standard classic differentiators where  we start, they are fast to slow, smart to  
39:07
not so smart, easy to use to hard to use, free to  expensive, focused to one size fits all, simple to  
39:16
complicated and integrated to siloed. And so you  could probably argue there's these others that  
39:24
should be included or some of those should be  taken off. But what we like about this is that   it's a small set. They're easy to understand. We know customers can understand these and  
39:34
they create a great starting place for your  team to think about differentiation because  
39:39
you can quickly look at this list and start  scoring where you think your product could be   on these scales and you know that if you can  use one of these, people will understand it.  
39:49
But it also starts to make the team comfortable  with this notion of differentiation. And again,  
39:54
we want to make differentiation something  that all of the co-founders or core team can  
40:00
participate in. It's not just the job of the  person writing the pitch deck. It's not just   the job of the marketer or the salesperson, but  we're getting everybody's perspective in on it  
40:11
and this is a great warm up activity before we  start to write our own custom differentiators.
Thoughts on price differentiation
40:17
Awesome. And then again, this is just  inspiration for coming up with more ways   to differentiate. Something that is a common  question I think for founders is price as a  
40:26
differentiator. Is there any insight you  guys have there? How often do you land on   price being a good differentiator  with the startups you work with?
40:32
I think price is rarely the  most important differentiator.   Part of what's interesting about going through  these classic differentiators, these standard  
40:41
ones first and then jumping into the custom ones  is that the classic ones are sort of universal,  
40:48
but it is going to be hard beat the competition  on very many of these. It's going to be hard to  
40:54
build a product that's faster than what Google  can build or what OpenAI can build. It's going   to be harder to be cheaper than those competitors  because they just have so many more resources.  
41:05
They can have lost leader products that are  underpriced. Where I think pricing has become a  
41:12
really clear advantage for some companies is those  that are leveraging AI to solve problems that were  
41:19
previously unsolvable with software. So we have  a company that we invested in called BindWell and  
41:28
they use AI to design precision pesticides. And we ran a foundation sprint with them right  
41:34
after investing and five years ago you couldn't  design pesticides with AI. It wasn't possible.  
41:42
Even if you had that idea, you wouldn't have been  able to build it and now you can. And so for them,   one of the big advantages is yeah, these  pesticides, they can be a lot cheaper because  
41:52
it doesn't require this massive team of R&D  chemists to tinker and experiment with things  
41:59
in the lab to try to create new pesticides.  We can design them with AI. So it is more   often true in AI companies like that, but it's  very difficult to compete on price in general.  
42:11
And we think we find that it is not as durable  of an advantage as some of these other things.
42:17
That is such a good point because historically  price has been don't compete on price for  
42:23
exactly what you said. It's hard to do  long term. It's kind right to the bottom,   especially if there's incumbents, they can  price a lot lower. But with AI, that is a  
42:31
really often and strong differentiator. Now do  this thing like cursor basically is competing on.  
42:39
You're saving engineering time and  it's worth so much money to you. At the same time, the output of  the AI is probably not going to  
42:46
be quite as good as a human process. So  it can be a little bit cheaper for now,  
42:51
but it has to be a lot cheaper. It has to  be... I've heard people offer 10X cheaper   than the legacy sort of manual approach to  solving that problem as the rule of thumb.
43:02
That's awesome. Okay. I'll just quickly reference,  there's an episode that will come out before   this with Modobon about pricing strategy and  there's a lot of discussion actually on this.
43:10
Oh, great. Especially with how to design your price with  customers as you're starting your company. Also,  
43:16
the episode with the founder of Superhuman Rahul,  he actually spent, there's a lot of cool context  
43:21
on how he differentiated Superhuman and  it was actually very much on speed. His   speed actually. Yeah, speed was where he  landed. And to your point, it was both...  
43:28
It was the Venn diagram of what you said, can  we do this and do people value it? And that's   where his research pointed to is people really  value this and they were able to achieve it.
Case study: Mellow
43:37
One of the things that's really interesting about  this example here that we're looking at Mellow is   that you can see that they were not the best on  all these scales. If teams are through and they're  
43:49
being really realistic about how they stack up  against the competition, it's normal and natural  
43:54
to find that you're not going to be the best on  all these differentiators. And that is really  
44:00
helpful for creating clarity in your positioning  and in your marketing because you're not going to   show a feature checklist chart that says you're  better at everything than every competitor. But  
44:11
if you can drive home one or two things that your  customers really care about and that you can be  
44:16
radically better at, it's going to improve your  chances of winning and finding product market fit. 
44:22
And we find that going through this process where  you're not just thinking about one differentiator   at a time or you're not trying to win on all  of them, but you're looking across this scale  
44:30
of options and you're being just really honest  about where you stack up can both point you in  
44:36
the right direction in terms of what you will win  on, but also can give you the comfort to say, hey,   it's okay if we're not better than every single  company on every single one of these things.
44:44
That's great context. That's going to make  people feel a lot better I think. Today's   episode is brought to you by Coda. I personally  use Coda every single day to manage my podcast  
44:55
and also to manage my community. It's where  I put the questions that I plan to ask every   guest that's coming on the podcast. It's where I  put my community resources. It's how I manage my  
45:03

Custom differentiators
46:05
Anything else on differentiation before we move  on to the third step of designing your approach? I think it's worth taking a look at what it looks  like when you have a bunch of these custom crafted  
46:17
differentiators, what that might look like.  Because in the case of Mellow, we've got,   I don't know, there must be 25 here. And so  they've written purposeful, magical, clear,  
46:28
personal, provides direction, flexible, human  creative, beautiful, and on and on. What they're  
46:35
trying to get at and what we want every team  to think about here is what is a new version  
46:41
of reality, a new lens that you can offer to  your customers on the world. Because a lot of   times you're building a new product, you actually  have to change the way people think about what's  
46:50
possible and what matters to them. Those classics  are often already well-trodden ground where other  
46:58
people have differentiated, they've already  thought about it, but these new particular   things that are possible with your technology that  you know is possible with the customer problem,  
47:07
the things that you believe might matter. It's really interesting to try some very  
47:12
fine-tuned list of sometimes just a slight  variation. We slightly change this wording  
47:17
or the way we describe what's great about what  we do. And that is the thing we think is really  
47:23
going to stand out. And again, you can see even  on this list that they've custom written, when we   see where they score it, they're not all the way  to the good end of the scale on all of them. When  
47:33
they get honest and look through, they're like,  well actually, maybe we can't deliver on this,   but this one we really can. And this one  we also suspect will matter to customers.
47:43
Where did Mellow land on the differentiators  they picked and where did Latchit Land? Yeah, let's take a look. For Mellow,  they trade out a bunch before they  
47:51
decided here. So they actually scored  with the competitors on these scales.
47:57
And just for context, Mellow is a tool  that allows you to run very simple,  
48:04
very targeted, very useful AI agents for common  everyday tasks like summarizing your email or  
48:13
cleaning up your calendar or drafting responses  to messages. And one of their insights was that  
48:19
there's been so many AI products that  have over-promised about being able to   replace all humans and do anything and 10X year  productivity, but so few of them have actually  
48:31
delivered on those promises. And so they have  this insight that if they can be really focused   and really human and really high quality and  they can deliver on that promise of making your  
48:43
life better by offloading tedious tasks that  that's going to really click with customers.
48:49
That's a great context. Thank you for adding that. So Mellow lands on mobile first and  works out of the box if there are two  
48:57
differentiators and they're trying to  differentiate from Gumloop and OpenAI is   sort of a generalized tool and Latchit  they're going to differentiate on...
49:10
We're pulling it up. If folks aren't watching,   he's pulling up the mirror board  to show us where they landed.
49:15
Latchit, they're going to differentiate on  helps you grow and cooperative. So when they   compare against Etsy, when they compare against  Shopify or setting up your table at an art fair,  
49:26
they're going to differentiate on  helps you grow and cooperative. And   they think none of the competitors  does both of those things well.
The mini manifesto
49:32
That is cool. Thank you for sharing that. And  to your point, this is where they think it   will work. And then the next step is actually  test this in the market, which is where we go  
49:40
from here. So let's move on to the next step in  which is the final step of the foundation sprint.
49:45
So closing off differentiation is a short step  that is just to create some project principles  
49:52
that'll help you make decisions in line with that  differentiation. And you were just talking about  
49:58
superhuman and differentiating on speed. And when  John and I worked at Google back in the 2000s,  
50:03
there was this list called 10 Things We've Found  To Be True. And one of the things on that list  
50:10
was fast is better than slow. And what was  interesting is this is a mantra that you  
50:16
would actually hear people using in meetings to  help dictate decisions. Well, we're considering  
50:21
this approach to this view or this approach,  this approach renders 12 milliseconds faster.  
50:30
That's probably going to be the one we're going  to take. It's going to be a really compelling   reason for us to not go with just the one that  renders faster or the one that gets the user  
50:38
to their benefit with one less click. And this notion that you can have a  
50:44
decision-making guide, we think we've seen it  be so useful for us in those contexts. We think,  
50:51
hey, this is an easy moment. You've got your  differentiators kind of loaded up in your mind.   Let's take a second here and just think, what's a  principle? How can we turn that into a principle?  
51:00
So if we take a look at Latchit, they've got  help sellers help each other. So if they're  
51:07
trying to make a decision between two approaches,  well, which one of these helps sellers help each   other or do the thing that makes sellers more  money? If we're choosing between two things,  
51:16
let's do the one that helps make them more  money. And so then we've kind of moved on.  
51:22
We've got a mini manifesto we call it, which is  that differentiation chart and these principles.  
51:27
And the notion is this page, the basics page was  just kind of the core simple stuff you need to  
51:33
know about this project. The mini manifesto  in one page is your decision-making guide.
51:39
This is so cool and this looks like it  would take a lot of work, but again,   this is just a day or two of sitting  around working through this framework.
51:48
Yeah, you'll get to this in four-ish hours. By the end of the first day, you'll have a mini  
51:54
manifesto that describes how you win  essentially as a company and a startup.
51:59
Or how you believe it's  going to work. And of course,   we're going to test it. Now, the  next phase of the foundation is- Believe it's going to work, and of course we're  going to test it. Now the next phase of the   foundation Sprint is locking in on the approach  we're going to start with. So we'll continue the  
Phase three: Approach to the project
52:09
story of Latch It here, it's easier to use an  example than to describe this in the abstract.  So coming into Character Labs, Latch  It had sort of four approaches in mind,  
52:19
but they weren't sure which one to take. So  they might build an app, that's one approach   they could take. They might build a sort  of newsletter platform. That's something  
52:28
obviously they knew how to do. They might build  a Shopify plugin, that's a simple way to kind   of piggyback on something people are already  doing. Their number one competitor is Shopify.  
52:38
Or they might have to build the full stack. And I  think a big question for them was, which of these  
52:43
and how much do we have to build before there's  enough value for customers that they're actually   going to adopt it and we're actually going to  get some traction and get this thing going?
52:51
And it's important to call out here that all  four of these approaches solve the same problem   for the same customer. And they're all likely  to differentiate from the competition in the  
53:02
same ways based on the unique advantages  that the founders Chris and James bring to  
53:08
this company. So these are not wildly different  product ideas or company ideas. These are just  
53:14
different approaches. You have the same  destination in mind, but you say, "Hey,   which path could we take?" It's like pulling up  directions on Google Maps. This one's a little  
53:21
faster, this one uses less fuel, this one avoids  tolls. What's the right approach for us to take?
53:27
And I love the work you did on that first  day eliminates a lot of ideas you probably   had that you would've probably spent  time building and then realizing, "Okay,  
53:35
this doesn't make any sense. It's  just like what everyone else has." Totally, totally, yeah. And we usually see  teams starting projects in one of two states.  
53:46
And one state is the state that Latch It  finds themselves in where, gosh, there's   a few different ways we could do this. How do we  decide? We can discuss and discuss and discuss,  
53:55
but that could go on forever. So that's state  one. We know there are some options. And state  
54:01
two is we're pretty locked in on one approach  already. We think we've got this figured out. 
54:07
In either of those cases, we think it's worth  taking, again, about four hours-ish to be really  
54:16
careful to lay out the options. If you think  there's only one option to sort of force yourself  
54:21
to think, well, what if this doesn't work?  What's another alternative? Or is there another   alternative that we have previously considered  and dismissed that we should maybe reconsider just  
54:30
to make sure? And end with a situation where  you've made a decision clearly about, okay,  
54:35
we've considered alternatives. This is our first  choice. And you've also identified this is our   backup plan. So that failure doesn't seem quite so  scary when we start to run experiments. And we're  
54:47
really able to pivot fast should that happen. So what we're going to do on the second day of  
Magic lenses activity
54:54
the foundation sprint through this sort of  third phase, which is the approach. Is to  
55:00
identify those different paths, so for Latch  It here, they've got a B, C and D options.  
55:06
We're going to color code those and then  we're going to plot them on these charts. So   we've got these different lenses. We call this  activity magic lenses. And the notion is, if  
55:16
we had a discussion about it, and we could ... as  investors, if we could imagine like waving a magic  
55:21
wand and putting the perfect team of advisors in  place to counsel the founders on this decision,  
55:27
we would love for them to have a customer  expert, somebody who's just brilliant vision  
55:33
for the product and the customer experience. And  they're hammering their fist on the table saying,  
55:38
"The customer, the customer, the customer, make  the decision that's best for the customer."  And so we'll plot those options on these axes  of easy to use versus hard to use and perfect  
55:49
solution to the customer problem versus this is  just an okay solution to the customer problem.  
55:54
And then similarly, we want an advisor who's  going to pound their fist on the table for  
55:59
building something cheap and fast, getting  it out into the market, being pragmatic,   get it out there as fast as possible. That's the  pragmatic lens. We want somebody who's going to  
56:07
advocate for growth. What's the way to reach  the most customers? Get it in people's hands   as fast as possible, easy to adopt. We want  somebody who's going to advocate for money,  
56:17
for the financial health of a business. So  what's going to create long-term value for   the customers? Where's the biggest audience of  these folks? We want to look at differentiation.  
56:27
Which we spent the first half of the Foundation  Sprint establishing. Well, we want consider   these approaches through that lens, as well. And so what the teams will do is to plot these  
56:37
options on these lenses. They'll almost  always create some lenses of their own,   some custom lenses that matter to them. They might  have one about their conviction. I think there's  
56:48
sort of a humorous one for Mellow where it's  like, which founder is like, "F yeah, that's  
56:54
exactly what I want to build." And on the other  end of the spectrum it's like, nah, just kind  
57:00
of the sort of heat of excitement that you feel.  That might be a really important decision point. That feels really important. That feels like that  
57:06
should be one of your ... you  call these the magic lenses? Yeah, yeah. It probably should be. It  probably should be [inaudible 00:57:11]- Yeah, I feel like ... just like how excited  
57:12
are you to build this? It feels  like a really important piece. Yeah, we saw that one in ... this is our  cohort of labs that's going on right now,  
57:18
and I'll bring that one up for context. If we add it, we can call it the Lenny lens.
57:24
The Lenny lens. Yeah. Oh, that's a good idea. In honor of. Yeah, so here it is. And you can see that Marie  is more likely to swear than Ben apparently. But  
57:36
it's crucial, right? And many founders, they'll  have different ... one of the challenges is that   for each founder, I think, each set of founders,  there's maybe a different way that they phrase  
57:45
what that means. What conviction means to  them. And maybe it's as simple as this,  
57:50
I just feel it, I just know. And sometimes it's  a little bit more like, well, it's conviction,  
57:56
but it's also, what's the data that we have behind  it? And that's what forms my intuition about it.
58:03
Awesome. I love that lens.  I love that you asterisk   out so it's not a little bit [inaudible 00:58:08].
58:09
A little bit. A little ...  just slightly concealed. Slightly. Yeah, if you zoom in, it's actually not censored. So the cool thing about this lens's thing is at  
58:20
the end, you've done all that, you've plotted  it all out. And if you're having a conversation   like that, you just have to sort of maintain in  memory, what did that person say? What did that  
58:28
other person say? What's that conversation I  had a week ago? Whatever. Here it's all laid  
58:34
out and sometimes you zoom out and it's  honestly as simple as like, "Oh, hey,   look, the blue one is in the top right quadrant of  almost every single lens. What is that one? What's  
58:46
going on? That might just be an easy decision." Sometimes you zoom out and you say, "Oh,  
58:51
clearly like nothing wins in every lens."  And that's actually really reassuring because   then you know there is no perfect decision.  There's nothing that checks all of the boxes.  
59:01
And that's going to help us decide. Because  now we decide which is the most important lens,  
59:07
which is the most important viewpoint to take.  And you can actually move forward in either way,  
59:13
either situation you get in where there's  sort of consistency across all the lenses   or there's not. You either pick a lens  or you just pick the consensus winner.
59:24
I love that this step answers a question that's  been the back of my mind that I think a lot of   people wonder is they're hearing this is just,  why don't I just build something and launch it  
59:33
and learn? And why am I spending all this time  sitting in a room? And this to me is a big part  
59:39
of the answer is just spending an hour or two  thinking through, here's the ideas we have.  
59:45
How do they compare on ... how do they look  on these magical lenses? Which makes so much   sense. How do they just filter on what customers  will love most, will help us grow the fastest,  
59:54
we'll drive the most money? Things like that.  It's such a simple, quick exercise that will   save you so much time building and launching and  having to spend time learning. That is weeks,  
1:00:04
days, months of work versus a couple hours.  It could save you so much over that time.
1:00:10
And it's also the case that you start  building something. It's exciting,   you can move fast. It's easier and easier to  see progress now with AI tools. And that act  
1:00:22
of building and starting to create something has  a momentum of its own that can be hard to stop.  
1:00:30
And if you're headed in the wrong direction,  you can spend a lot of time building and making  
1:00:35
progress. But it's just, if it's not progress in  the right direction, it's actually hurting you. 
1:00:41
And that's why we want people to pause and  take this. It's really, as you said earlier,  
1:00:47
the ROI is high. But it feels very unnatural to  pause when you're so excited at the beginning  
1:00:54
and ready to go. To pause and say, "Okay, let's  make sure we're taking the right path." But just   imagine you're Gandalf, you're Frodo, you're  starting off, you're trying to get to Mordor,  
1:01:05
it's a long trip. You don't want  to take the wrong path. You want   to take the ... think before you start  marching through the swamps or whatever.
1:01:13
One phenomenon we've seen when teams are  building things really quickly with AI is  
1:01:19
that the more AI-generated or assisted  they are, the more generic they tend to   turn out. Which makes sense if you think  about how LLMs were developed, they're all  
1:01:27
basically pre-trained on the same data. And so  in this excitement, in this rush to say, "Wow,   look at how fast we can build it." You actually  end up with something that is less differentiated  
1:01:38
than what already exists in the world. And then  let's say you launch it, and that takes longer  
1:01:43
than building sort of a clickable prototype.  But you launch it because you're moving so fast.  And then you get data from the people who managed  to find that thing about what they did with it.  
1:01:54
But you don't get any data about what they didn't  do with it. And you certainly don't get any data  
1:01:59
about the people who never found it, who never  tried it. Maybe they landed on your website and   they're like, blah, another generic AI-generated  thing, that's not worth my time. And so  
1:02:11
we think it's really helpful to basically put  yourself in a situation where you can slow down  
1:02:17
a little bit and do some hard thinking, some deep  thinking about what's actually going to make your  
1:02:22
product unique. And then you can switch into this  mode of like, okay, great. Now let's go as fast  
1:02:28
as possible and get that out into customer's  hands. But if you don't take this step first,  
1:02:34
it's actually kind of counterintuitive that going  fast can actually slow you down in the long run.
Prototyping and testing
1:02:39
Yeah, to build on that, I had  this guest recently, Bob Baxley. Yeah, we know Bob. Okay. So he has this really interesting insight.  He calls it ... I think he calls it the Primal  
1:02:51
Mark. Essentially his feedback is, wait  as long as possible to start any sort of   sketch or prototype, because as soon as  you start drawing what you're building,  
1:03:01
now everything you do will be a response to  that. And so the more time you can spend before  
1:03:06
starting to concept out the solution, the more  likely you are to land on something that works.
1:03:12
That is super interesting and it is- Counterintuitive [inaudible 01:03:18].
1:03:18
And I find myself challenged to think about it  in the context of the sprints that we run with   founders. But I think one way to interpret that  in the work that we do is that we used to just  
1:03:30
run design sprints with every team, that was  our hammer and everything looked like a nail.  
1:03:35
And part of what we found so valuable about  doing the Foundation Sprint is that it keeps   you away from ideation for just a little bit  longer. And it forces you to think about why  
1:03:48
you're unique and the market that you're going  into before you get to that moment of creating  
1:03:54
something that looks realistic and then maybe  being a little bit locked into that approach.
1:03:59
That's such a ... like I love that this emerged  out of that. Like you guys were so design sprint  
1:04:06
oriented, and it's just like, cool, let's just  make prototypes, let's design, let's make it real,   let's show people. And that's, I think, where  a lot of people's minds are at more and more.  
1:04:14
And maybe as a result, and this is almost like,  okay, maybe that wasn't the right approach to   start. Maybe it's actually better to think  a little bit of what we want to design and  
1:04:23
build before. And so just the fact that you guys  spent so much of your life and time on that. And   then realize this is actually potentially  even more important to do, it says a lot.
1:04:34
And ideas always get distilled down to one thing  that people grab onto and they focus on. And I  
1:04:41
think with the design sprint, it got distilled  down to just build a prototype. Just quit messing  
1:04:48
around and build something. But the reality is  when you run a design sprint, it's five days and  
1:04:54
you don't build the prototype until the fourth  day. So you do a bunch of work to figure out  
1:05:01
how does our customer learn about this thing? What  are the different ideas that we're bringing to  
1:05:06
what our solution could look like? Which of those  are the most likely to work? And only then at the  
1:05:11
end of the week are you building a prototype. But I do think that as that method has become   really widely known, people just think  about let's build something. And then  
1:05:21
once you multiply that times the power of AI,  it definitely creates this narrative that the  
1:05:28
only way to build something new is to just  create the product as quickly as possible.  
1:05:33
And that doesn't really match our experience,  that doesn't really fit the pattern of what  
1:05:39
we've seen working best across the few  hundred companies that we've worked with. I think this validates in some ways the role of  a product manager where the PM's job is to help  
1:05:52
the team figure out what should we be building and  are we all aligned on what we're building before   we start designing and building? This process is  almost like the product requirements document of  
1:06:04
a company. Which I think a lot of product people  listening to this will feel really good about.
1:06:09
Yeah, we see this as a great tool for product  people. It's a way to give you a structure for  
1:06:16
leading your team through those decisions.  And a way to give all the folks on a team,  
1:06:24
including the person who's the product leader.  But the person who's the engineering leader,  
1:06:29
the person who's the marketing leader, sales  leader, the design leaders, the exact right  
1:06:35
opportunity to contribute and participate in  forming the strategy. The exact right opportunity  
1:06:41
as we get into design sprints, following the  foundation sprints, to then make it real. And  
1:06:47
turn that idea, that hypothesis about what might  work into hopefully evidence that it does work.
1:06:54
I feel like it's actually more helpful  to engineers, like non-product people,   because I think a PM my brain  would be like, I want to do this  
1:07:03
intuitively. Whether they do it right or not. I  think it's other functions almost they're like,   no, let's just jump straight to  design, straight to prototyping. 
1:07:10
Let me ask you ... while we're on this tangent,  we're on this wild tangent out of this process,   but want to ... this question has been in my mind.  Because I recently had a founder on the podcast,  
1:07:21
Maor, who built this company called Base44.  He built it, it sold in six months for $80  
1:07:26
million. And this journey of that is he just  had a problem he wanted to solve for himself,  
1:07:32
for his girlfriend, for a scouts program. He  built it, people started using it, and he kind  
1:07:37
of evolved it from there. And obviously he didn't  go through a process like this. Thoughts on just  
1:07:42
like, is it okay to just do that? When should  someone think about, "Okay, I should actually  
1:07:47
set aside time to do a Foundation Sprint."  Versus, I'm just motivated to solve a problem   for my friends. I'm just going to build it, evolve  it, iterate with them, and kind of go from there.
1:07:58
One of the observations from our hundreds of  experiences working alongside founders in the  
1:08:06
early days of their projects and watching  them make decisions and watching them try  
1:08:12
things and succeed or fail, is that there are  so many founders who are incredibly bright,  
1:08:20
incredibly capable. They have great insights  about the market, about an opportunity. And yet,  
1:08:28
their startup does not work out. And there's  a problem with selection bias that we hear  
1:08:35
from the folks who they were brilliant, they  checked all those boxes I just described. They  
1:08:41
saw a great opportunity, they were smart, they  executed well, they had courage and conviction,  
1:08:47
and they did it and it worked out,  and it was a tremendous success.  And I think that the danger in thinking  like, "Well, they didn't follow a process,  
1:08:55
so I don't need to." And that may be true and  maybe you don't need it. But what we believe is  
1:09:04
you have a better ... this just increases your  odds. This is a chance to get more clear on,  
1:09:09
is this a good opportunity? To get more clear  on, will the thing I build click with customers? 
1:09:14
And if you've already figured out that no, this  thing's ... my product has taken off, my product  
1:09:21
is working. We've actually had founders in labs  who they started off character labs and they said,  
1:09:27
"I started selling this thing and it's already  taking off. I want to stop running experiments."   And we're like, "Yeah, stop running experiments."  You don't need to do this if you've got product  
1:09:36
market fit, if you've got evidence that this  thing is clicking and you have conviction,   run with it. But if you're not there,  this is a great path to get you going.  
1:09:47
And if you're not sure if the thing you're  going to build is going to turn into that   $80 million exit in six months, we believe  this is a good chance to improve your odds.
1:09:59
People hearing this might feel like, I haven't  heard of any company doing this that has become  
Real-world examples and success stories
1:10:04
a trillion dollar IPO success. What would make  me believe that this is the process I should  
1:10:11
follow versus just, I'm just going to do what I  hear on YC, just build it, launch it, iterate,   that kind of thing. What can you share to give  people confidence this is the approach to take?
1:10:20
Well, the first thing I'd say is give us some  time where we're pretty new to this. We started   Character Labs about three years ago. We created  the Foundation Sprint about three years ago.  
1:10:30
But more seriously, when we were creating this  method, one of the things that we did was look  
1:10:35
back across all the projects we've been involved  in and the ones that were really successful,   and we looked for patterns. And while those  teams didn't have the Foundation Sprint,  
1:10:45
they ended up having really clear differentiation  and a really clear view of what made them unique  
1:10:52
that they were able to build on. And as we  ran design sprints with them, we were able to   test and validate against that differentiation. So  we believe that this is sort of a key to success,  
1:11:03
even if those teams didn't have  access to this exact same methodology. So what I'm hearing is this  is essentially like Alpha in  
1:11:10
starting a company. This is a new process  that companies are just starting to use.   You guys are working closely with founders,  and it's rooted in the success of many, many,  
1:11:21
many companies that you guys were involved  in early on and continue to be involved in. Yeah, it's based off of this thing we've  seen again and again in the most successful  
1:11:30
projects. When we're inside the room in the early  days and we're seeing people make decisions,  
1:11:36
this is what drives those decisions.  It's differentiation. And so if we look  
1:11:41
back across all of the sprints that  we've been a part of over the years,   and John and I have been inside lots of  these rooms, lots of these conversations.
1:11:51
And if you're not watching on YouTube, by the  way, there's a cool visual that Jake is showing. Yeah, it spans across Google, Google Ventures,  Character Capital, and if you're watching  
1:11:59
on YouTube, you'll see all these little white  circles. And each one sort of represents a company   that we've seen inside of during these design  sprints. And there are a lot of really great  
1:12:10
success stories in there. We've had the chance to  ... I mentioned the story of Google Meet and being  
1:12:15
there and figuring out what is it that's going to  make this thing stand out? That was what made the  
1:12:21
project finally start to take off. And to this day  is still sort of what animates it. Being inside  
1:12:27
of the early days of what became Google Photos or  Google Trips and some of the early design sprints,  
1:12:33
and there are a lot of others on here. But honestly, of course, we've also seen   inside a lot that it didn't work out. If we looked  inside the greatest hits though, the real smash  
1:12:45
successes, we looked inside all of those. We  realized there is a common element, and that  
1:12:50
common element in all of them is differentiation.  That there was clarity around this is what we're  
1:12:56
trying to prove to customers, this is the promise  we're making. And so we've been on those teams,   or we've worked alongside those founders  who have this clear idea of differentiation.  
1:13:05
And sometimes they're not right. They run the  experiments and they change it. But the thing is,  
1:13:11
they're keyed into differentiation as being  crucial. They're not just thinking about the   product and trying to get the right shape of the  product or trying to make it usable or whatever.  
1:13:20
They're really keyed in on differentiation and how  do we find the right promise and deliver on that   promise and express that promise to customers. So to explain a little bit quickly of what I mean  
1:13:30
by differentiation and how this has manifested in  products we've seen, if you go back to the early   days of Gmail in the 2000s, if you had email,  you were probably using Hotmail or Yahoo and it  
1:13:41
worked fine and you didn't have to think about it.  And this new product comes along and you're like,   "God, I'm not going to want to switch my email  address. What a hassle. Who wants to do that? No  
1:13:50
one." Gmail's promise was, hey, massive storage,  great search. And as we were building the product  
1:13:57
out and marketing and explaining it to people and  making decisions inside the project, we had to  
1:14:04
continue to deliver on great search. Great search,  great search, that was key to standing out. 
1:14:09
You fast forward to 2014, and we're working with  this tiny company who's now competing with Gmail,  
1:14:14
who's now sort of the market leader people are  used to using in their teams. And here's this  
1:14:21
new messaging software called Slack, and they're  trying to reach new customers. And gosh, switching  
1:14:27
to Slack is an even bigger hassle than switching  to your email address because everybody on the  
1:14:32
team has to switch. Well, Slack says, "Hey, if you  believe that having fun and boosting teamwork is  
1:14:38
important, it's going to be clear to you. This is  a new way of looking at the world." And when they   were making their decisions in their first big  ad campaign, their first big marketing campaign,  
1:14:48
this was what they were trying to convey to  customers. So we kind of see that from the inside.  Another one, we didn't see this one from  the inside, but in one that we're all  
1:14:55
sort of familiar with is what happened  with ChatGPT. It goes from this trusted,   I don't have to think about it, I'm going to  run a Google search. To, oh, wow. It's a new  
1:15:03
way of looking at the world. There's zero clicks,  just tells you the answer. This thing's great. 
1:15:08
This is also something that we've seen in  some of the early success stories from our   own portfolio. So 2019, this company called  Reclaim going after calendar management. And  
Motivation behind The Foundation Sprint
1:15:20
most of us manage our own calendars, most  of us don't have administrators helping us   out with that. And it's free, we're in control.  Reclaim's argument was, hey, we can automatically,  
1:15:30
we can use AI to help you focus and to  automatically prioritize your calendar. And   that animated enough people to take the plunge  and switch and try it out, that they were able  
1:15:40
to build up an audience of tens of thousands  of users, and Dropbox acquired them last year.
1:15:46
A great answer to my question, you  guys well-prepared for those skeptics.
1:15:52
Part of our motivation, our selfish motivation  with this Foundation Sprint is that now that we  
1:15:58
are investing our own money into companies  and we're working with all these founders,   we want them to have that same clarity on  differentiation. We saw how important that  
1:16:08
was to Gmail and to Slack and to all these  other companies. And we want to bring that,   we want to give them that same advantage  and help them avoid the pitfalls that all  
1:16:19
the other unsuccessful teams and companies  that we've seen have fallen into. So that's   kind of what we're trying to do here,  is bring the lessons from these really  
1:16:27
successful teams into any team that  reads the book and runs this process.
1:16:33
And the special sauce that John and I bring  is that we're obsessed with the sequence of  
1:16:39
decisions that you make and how you work together  with your team to make good decisions quickly.  
1:16:45
And that specificity about the method is something  that we do have a lot of evidence behind it  
1:16:52
working well because of what's happened with the  design sprint and with how many successful teams   have run that at those companies who are trillion  dollar or whatever kind of giant ... all kinds of  
1:17:04
teams run design sprints. This is that same  methodology around how we work together at  
1:17:09
high velocity and high quality. And it's just  brought to a different part of the process.
1:17:14
Excellent answer. Speaking of the method,   we went on the world's most epic tangent. I  want to bring us back. We haven't finished  
The outcome of the sprint: The founding hypothesis
1:17:22
actually going through the process. I think  we're towards the tail end of it. So let's   just finish that. What else do you do? So  you have this ... I guess, catch us up.
1:17:30
Let's catch up with Latch It. So as a refresher  for you who forgot. Latch It are building this  
1:17:36
tool for artisans, they want to help them  sell with the community networking features  
1:17:42
like you might find on Substack. And  they've identified their differentiation,  
1:17:48
they've identified their approach now  using magic lenses. And all of this is  
1:17:53
going to come together to create a founding  hypothesis. So if we help Artisans solve  
1:17:58
online sales growth with a social sales app,  and then they've also got their backup plan. Or we could-
1:18:03
A social sales app. Then, they've also got their  backup plan, or we could build the full stack   solution if that doesn't work. We believe  they're going to choose it over Shopify and  
1:18:09
Etsy because our solution is cooperative  and easy to use. In this single sentence,  
1:18:15
we've laid bare their strategy, and now they're  going to try to find out does that work?
1:18:21
That is so cool. The output of the  sprint is the founding hypothesis.   I love that the term hypothesis  is a part of this because it's  
1:18:29
not telling you this will work. It's  this is the thing you will now test. Absolutely. Every project has at its core ...  Every new product has at its core a hypothesis.  
1:18:42
There is a founding hypothesis. It's just  usually not explicit. It's usually hidden,  
1:18:47
and different people on the team may  have different ideas about what it is.  Because it's not explicit, it's  very hard to interrogate it and  
1:18:54
test it and find out if the different  variables in it are the right variables.
1:18:59
I'm curious what's in that photo to the  right as you're showing the YouTube. Oh, yeah, if you're on YouTube. We did this  spread together in person. On Lachit's board,  
1:19:09
you're going to see that here's where they wrote  it out and took a photo of it and dropped it in,   and then later filled it out on the Miro board.
1:19:18
Beautiful. It has their old name there there. That's right. Yeah. Yeah. Every brand that. Lyric, which it turns out is not the easiest for  SEO. There's a lot of lot of Lyrics out there.
1:19:27
There is a lot of Lyrics. I know  some Lyrics. Just so I understand,   is the next step, the design sprint, and  that's where you actually start testing?
The Design Sprint
1:19:34
Exactly. If we zoom out now we see now they're  going to head into a sequence of design sprints   running one after another. Each of those design  sprints starts with the founding hypothesis. 
1:19:44
Then, the team is going to say, "Okay,  what are the biggest risks that ... That   hypothesis not being true? What  do we need to assess right now?" 
1:19:51
Going to make a map of how customers discover the  product, what that core experience looks like,   and then figure out using that map, where's  the key moment for assessing that risk? 
1:20:02
For them, the biggest risk is do people even ...  Will these artisans even want this thing? Are   they actually going to want to have a community  sharing sales platform? They decide the key moment  
1:20:13
for us to test that, it's actually on the landing  page. They figure we can prototype landing pages   that describe the product and learn a lot for  our first experiment, just with landing pages. 
1:20:23
They're going to sketch solutions. This  will be familiar to anyone who's heard   about design sprints. Each person sketching  their own proposal for how that key moment  
1:20:32
should work. Choose the strongest of those. In this case, they choose ... They're going   to actually prototype three things. They test  three things head-to-head against each other,  
1:20:42
fake brands for each one. They  look like three different products.  Then, this is a really key part. At the end of  the design sprint, we've got a scorecard. This  
1:20:51
is actually a new innovation. This  is not in the [inaudible 01:20:54]. Oh, shit. Here we go. Hot off the  presses, design sprint improvement.
1:20:59
This scorecard is going to break down the founding  hypothesis. Hey, as we talk to each customer,   was this the right person? Is the right kind of  customer for us? Do they have the problem that we  
1:21:09
think they have? Was this the right approach for  them? Did they choose it over the competition? 
1:21:14
They're going to test these prototypes  head-to-head, and also show people like,   okay, here's Etsy, here's Shopify. Now, out of  all these five options, think about, out loud,  
1:21:23
about how do you compare these? Do we believe  they'd actually choose it? Did the differentiation  
1:21:30
actually work? Are those differentiators  valuable and motivating to them? Does it click? 
1:21:36
Our new book is called Click. The idea there is  you can see when a product clicks with one person,  
1:21:44
and that's a helpful signal. Now, granted, these  interviews are kind of a simulation. It's not like  
1:21:49
the real world, but they're a helpful signal that  we're on track for product market fit. If we see,  
1:21:55
gosh, this product just seems to be clicking  with customer after customer, that's a really   strong signal. That's when people start to  get the confidence that it's time to build.
1:22:03
That's a really good term, by the  way. I feel that's such a good way   to describe what it feels like.  It doesn't just click with them.
1:22:08
Just kind of clicks. Yeah. If you  look across Latchet's first scorecard,  
1:22:13
there's a ton of red. It's a  lot of things that didn't work. [inaudible 01:22:17].
1:22:18
The conclusion at the end ... In this  last column, there's a conclusion, hey,   we interviewed ... In this case, they interviewed  four customers. Well, it looks like this is the  
1:22:26
right customer. It looks like they have this  problem, but everything else kind of didn't work   about the hypothesis. Approach wasn't working,  differentiation wasn't working. There's some  
1:22:35
mini hypotheses about the prototype itself. Just  lots of red on here, so they sprint again and-
1:22:42
Just zooming out for a second, this is a team  who just started working on this new company.  
1:22:48
Sometimes it can feel slow. We talked about  it feeling slow to go through all these steps,  
1:22:53
but they're only a week in. They've already  built three prototypes, and they've tested  
1:22:58
those three prototypes with four real customers. They have this super detailed scorecard of here's  
1:23:04
what's working, here's what's not working. That's  after a week. It's interesting how what can feel  
1:23:10
slow in the hour to hour actually can really  speed you up in the weeks and months timescale.
1:23:17
That was such good context, because I  was feeling that. To your point, most   founders do not do this much testing, iterating,  learning in the first few weeks of their startup.
1:23:26
Yeah. They might spend a few weeks just talking  to customers without showing a prototype,   and then they might spend a few months building an  MVP, and then they might ... Maybe they're going  
1:23:35
to spend some more time talking to customers  while showing them the MVP. Maybe they'll do   manual onboarding, something like that. Yeah, that plays out over months. It fits  
1:23:43
with what founders tell us. Of course it's a  subjective measure, but founders who go through  
1:23:49
this process with us, they say that they're able  to accelerate three to four months of work into   the three or four weeks back-to-back sprints  that we're doing together in Character Labs.
1:23:59
Excellent context. Thanks  for throwing that in there. These conversations with customers are so much  more fruitful and pointed when you've got the  
1:24:07
context of I know exactly what my hypothesis  is and you have prototypes to show them.  We have a founder in our group of startups and  Character Labs at the moment. I'm thinking of  
1:24:17
Maruthi John who comes from doing sales at  Rippling, who had been talking to tons of  
1:24:23
customers while starting off the ... His company.  He said, "I've had 50 conversations over the past  
1:24:31
month, but I learned so much more from even the  first conversation when I had a hypothesis and I  
1:24:36
had a prototype, or a couple prototypes,  to show them. It's like night and day."
1:24:42
That is a great example. This all  makes sense. As you guys describe it,   you're actually testing something very  concrete that your entire team is aligned  
1:24:51
behind and actual prototypes, and you've  thought about different directions. You're  
1:24:56
testing something very specific versus just  generally testing at your general concept.
1:25:02
As we go into the second design sprint  for Latchet, they're making some edits  
1:25:09
to their founding hypothesis. Now, they're  revising a few things, making new sketches,  
1:25:17
new proposals for what this solution might look  like. They've learned a lot in that first sprint,  
1:25:22
a new prototype. They've got a prototype that  has more detail now. They are engineers. They're  
1:25:28
starting to actually write some code and put some  more detail behind the product. It's more robust.   Again, they're trying to fix that positioning. Here's their scorecard. If you're watching on  
1:25:39
YouTube, you'll be able to see it. Again,  there's a lot of red here. At first blush,   the scorecard is bleeding, but there are  some promising signs. There's like maybe a  
1:25:48
few little sunbreaks, there's some spots where  some of the red has started to flip to yellow. 
1:25:54
If we look at the conclusion on the far  right, they're starting to believe their   differentiation is dialed in, and they're  starting to believe that this could be the  
1:26:02
right approach. They may be able to get  people to choose it to the competition,   even though they haven't done it yet. Those are  starting to become yellow lights on the scorecard. 
1:26:12
Now they'll take what they've learned, and  now we're into the third consecutive week of  
1:26:17
design sprints. Again, they're going to sort  of review that founding hypothesis. They're   going to sketch. They're recruiting a new slate of  customers, as they do each week. A new prototype,  
1:26:27
again, more code in the prototype.  It's becoming more and more robust,  
1:26:32
more realistic as they're also adjusting the  marketing and the positioning at the same time. 
1:26:37
All of these things kind of go in concert.  The product itself and the marketing are   sort of one as they're moving along,  and this is an extreme example of-
1:26:47
What? [inaudible 01:26:48]. Everything is green. Everything's green. [inaudible 01:26:50]. If you can't see it, every single one is green. Oh my god.
1:26:53
This is extreme, but it is  a pattern that we've seen. This is real. Again and again. This is a real example.
1:26:58
Wow. How do I invest to get us  in this round? This is great. Yes, this is pretty great. This is great. Nice job.
1:27:05
We see this again and again. I can share a  couple of other boards of ones that are in  
1:27:11
progress. We're also constantly adjusting  the template so you can get to see a   little bit more how people will edit their  founding hypothesis from sprint to sprint. 
1:27:19
Mellow, who we were talking about, here's  their first prototype, and here's their first  
1:27:25
scorecard. Lots of yellow for them. Maybe they're  a little bit more likely to use yellow than red. 
1:27:31
Then, here's the edits to their founding  hypothesis after the first sprint. You can   kind of see in red, they're slightly changing  the definition of their target customer from  
1:27:41
the first week, slightly changing the problem that  they're solving, slightly changing the approach,  
1:27:47
slightly changing the competition. They've dialed in, they've gotten   more crisp on who are we up against.  They've gotten a little bit more crisp,  
1:27:53
just a tiny tweak, on what ... How do we  explain this to people to get them excited  
1:27:58
about it? What's the differentiation? They  sprint again, they prototype again. If we   just jump down, and just looking at hypotheses,  they learn a bunch. Now there's another slight  
1:28:07
tweak to that founding hypothesis. Week  after week you're learning, but you're  
1:28:14
also really able to track exactly what is it that  we learned and how does that affect our strategy.
The role of AI in prototyping
1:28:20
Okay, guys, this was incredible. I think we've  covered the entire process. I love that you   also covered the design sprint pieces, which  isn't part of this book, but is such a core. 
1:28:31
Clearly these things are very connected and meant  to work together. You go from here's the thing we  
1:28:36
should be building to how to actually test it. Let me ask you before we wrap up, is there   anything else that you think is really important  for people to know before they start trying this  
1:28:46
process at home? Is there anything you can  point them to actually try this at home?
1:28:51
One thing we didn't talk about, we used  an example of a company who's not building  
1:28:57
an AI-first product. Latchet's building this  network community sales platform for artisans. 
1:29:06
It'd probably be interesting to look at how  people use this when they are building a very   technical product, when they're vibe coding  prototypes. That's a question we're getting  
1:29:15
all the time. What's the influence on this of  the speed with which you can build something? That's an awesome idea. Let's definitely do that.
1:29:20
Yeah. Okay. Let's jump in here and take a look  at a company again, in our current group of labs  
1:29:26
teams, Axion Orbital it's called. The founder,  [inaudible 01:29:30], is actually running this  
1:29:31
whole process solo, which is pretty cool too.  He's a remarkable guy. We have a couple of solo   founders right now who are able to generate ... You can see, just to give a sneak peek,  
1:29:42
he's generating, when we talk about customers,  all these sticky notes himself and making the   decisions himself about which is the right one. To ground us in this story, his founding  
1:29:51
hypothesis is he wants to help geospatial  devs solve these sort of complex workflows  
1:29:56
with a browser-based no-code development  environment. We'll take a look just really  
1:30:02
quickly at what his prototypes look like. In the first week ... I can show you  
1:30:08
this prototype right here, and it's a  marketing page. On this marketing page,  
1:30:15
there's a link to a video. If I click find out  more, I'm going to see this video. This video  
1:30:24
is going to kind of hear [inaudible 01:30:27]  talking over it. It's going to kind of walk  
1:30:30
through a screen share of a very rudimentary  version of what this product might look like. 
1:30:36
Now, if you're watching on YouTube and you  see this prototype, you might think, "Boy,   that marketing page and the demo itself, pretty  bare bones. Not the most polished-looking. This  
1:30:48
doesn't look super compelling." He was focusing in that first sprint   on the messaging, on finding those people who  actually have that role, testing it with them,  
1:30:57
and he learned a lot. If we sort of go  back to his scorecard, we'll see, okay,  
1:31:02
that was a pretty good one. Actually, a lot  of green on his first scorecard, but he also   felt like what he tested was pretty incomplete. Now, one thing that's cool here, we saw the big  
1:31:12
leap with Latchet from one week to another in  terms of their learnings and the scorecards.   One of the things that's interesting here  is to go from [inaudible 01:31:19]'s first  
1:31:19
prototype here to his second prototype. It's obvious he's been able to just build  
1:31:25
a ton in the next week. He's using AI-based  tools. He's doing a lot of work. He's also  
1:31:31
just a terrific engineer. Here we've got a much  more real-looking marketing page, very detailed. 
1:31:38
An important thing that he's done here with  this is he's built out a lot and created a  
1:31:43
video of something so that the product, while  not fully functional, you can see exactly how  
1:31:48
it works. If we sort of play this video, he's  created this demonstration of what it looks  
1:31:54
like when you type in a query into the engine  and exactly the kinds of results you get. By  
1:32:00
doing a combination of vibe coding, real coding,  all of which is based off of pencil sketches,  
1:32:07
we can go back and see the sketches he's doing  on paper to define this is what I think needs to   be in there to make this compelling to deliver on  my differentiation, and then he's using a product  
1:32:16
video so that the entire thing doesn't have to  work fully freeform. That's what it can look  
1:32:21
like when a team is building something that's more  AI-centric, when it's a more sophisticated tool,  
1:32:28
when people are going to be curious  about sort of the ins and outs of it. Along those lines, where do  you find people are leveraging  
1:32:36
AI most in helping them through these  sprints, through either the foundation   sprint or the design sprint? Is it  mostly just vibe coding prototypes?
1:32:45
That's definitely the first and biggest use of  AI in sprints so far is in making prototypes  
1:32:52
that look more realistic faster. It's kind  of like having an entire prototyping team  
1:33:00
on standby so that you don't have to just make  it yourself and sort of piece things together,   but you can have a ton of people ready to  jump in, make something look really realistic. 
1:33:12
It's also really critical we found that while  you're outsourcing that prototyping work,   you don't outsource the thinking. You don't kind  of skip over the part where you think about,  
1:33:23
"Well, what is the actual copy on the website?  How do I actually describe what the product is,   how it's differentiated?" It's  one of the reasons why doing the  
1:33:34
foundation sprint first and then doing  a design sprint can really help you,  
1:33:40
because it allows you to spend time  working on that harder part of what  
1:33:46
it means to design and build a product. Then, once you have a clear view of that,   then you can use AI tools to go really  fast. In this example that Jake is showing  
1:33:55
of Axion Orbital, people get really clever  about which parts of this need to be real,   which parts of this can be vibe coded, which  parts of this can just be a static Figma mockup. 
1:34:04
It's all about kind of creating a simulation,  something that looks realistic, that you can  
1:34:09
put in front of real customers to  help you answer the key questions. That's a really good point that you're  making. Again, it's just a reminder,  
1:34:17
you'll move faster if you slow down a little  bit at the beginning, that because prototyping   is so easy now and just things that look  ... It's so easy to make something that  
1:34:24
looks really nice and kind of it's doing what  you want, but spending a little time making   sure you understand what you're testing  and what you want becomes more important.
1:34:33
We had a couple of teams in this current group of  Character Labs where they jumped to vibe coding   prototypes right away at the very beginning. When you generate something using an LLM,  
1:34:45
using an AI tool, it looks pretty real. It looks  believable. I think there's a temptation to say,  
1:34:52
"Okay, this is good to go. It looks close enough  that I'm just going to show that to customers." 
1:34:58
Then what they found was, actually, it was  super generic. It didn't really describe  
1:35:05
what the product was. It didn't really describe  how it was different because it was generated  
1:35:10
by a model that is trained on existing products. In that second sprint, that was when they really  
1:35:17
took a step back and said, "Okay, let's think  through this and then shift into prototyping   mode." It's definitely helping people speed up,  but we also think there's an important lesson here  
1:35:26
that while you're outsourcing prototyping,  don't outsource the thinking as well.
1:35:32
I see you pulling something  up, Jake, that might be ... Yeah. I imagine you want to show. Yeah, I think it's kind of interesting to see the  sketches that went into [inaudible 01:35:40]'s  
1:35:40
prototype, the Axion Orbital prototype that we  just looked at, because they are super detailed.  This is ... Doing this level of thought where  you're pausing, you're being really intentional  
1:35:51
about what does the customer need to know,  what needs to happen for them to find a  
1:35:56
solution to their problem and within the product,  that's a way of doing your prompt engineering. 
1:36:04
If you end up vibe coding this prototype, but  you start off with a very clear plan about this   is what the thing needs to look like, rather  than going immediately into a conversational  
1:36:14
mode where you're co-designing with the LLM  and going back and forth via chat conversation,  
1:36:20
this is much likelier to yield an opinionated  product that makes sense, that's very clearly  
1:36:27
defined around the problem that you're trying  to solve, the tasks that need to happen to   solve that problem, and the right messaging,  the right wording. It's really crisply aligned  
1:36:36
with what you know about your customers,  what you know about what they care about. That's such a good point. Again, just the  concept of the primal mark is ringing in my  
1:36:44
head as you talk about this. Just as soon as you  make that prototype, everything from that point   is a response to that first idea, versus have  I actually thought through what this should be. 
Final thoughts and resources
1:36:54
Guys, we did it. This is incredible. I think  this is going to help a lot of people think   through and actually save a lot of time. Is  there anything else that you want to share,  
1:37:04
leave listeners with? Maybe a last  nugget or something you want to,   I don't know, just double down on to  leave folks with before we wrap up.
1:37:10
Well, one quick thing is that we've shared a lot  of examples in this conversation. We actually have  
1:37:18
a template, a Miro template, that folks can use  if they want to run their own foundation sprint. 
1:37:24
It's the template that we use  when we're working with founders,   taking them through these sprints. We do our  work in Miro. Even if we're in person with them,  
1:37:31
we're usually working in Miro, or maybe working  on paper and then capturing it in Miro because   it's just such a great canvas to work on. We'll make that template available so anybody  
1:37:41
who's listening or watching can grab that and  use it to run their own foundation sprint.
1:37:47
That's amazing. You answered the question I asked  that I forgot to come back to. Can we give people   a URL? Put it in the show notes, but is it at  your ... Yeah, I guess where can folks find it?
1:37:57
You should find it at character.vc. You can go  there and we'll have a page for you to ... Yeah.
1:38:04
Amazing. So easy. That is awesome. That's  awesome that you guys are doing that.   Obviously you could also read the book.  That goes through a lot of this process,  
1:38:10
but I think the template is just like a  plug and play. Let's just do this at home.  Obviously, if they want to go deeper, they  can work with you guys to have you ... It's  
1:38:18
such a win. They take money. You give them  money and you help them figure out what   the heck to build. What a deal. That's also  character.vc if they want to explore that.
1:38:28
Yeah. Yep. Amazing. Okay. Is there anything else, Jake,  that you wanted to share before we close up?
1:38:34
No, just if you made it this far, hopefully  your mind and heart is open to this idea,  
1:38:41
but we know it's a lot to ask, to clear the  calendar and follow these steps. If John and  
1:38:49
I weren't so convinced that beginnings are  essential to getting your best efforts in  
1:38:55
the hands of people and to achieving the things  you want for your customers, we wouldn't be doing  
1:39:01
this. We wouldn't be going to all the trouble.  There are simpler things we could be going after. 
1:39:07
The kind of cool thing we've found  about working in this way, though,   we've focused a lot on finding product market  fit and building your business, getting started,  
1:39:16
getting momentum, getting alignment, all these  things that tactically are important, that   business-wise are important, but another part of  it that's a nice side benefit, that actually maybe  
1:39:27
is the most important thing of all, is how close  it brings you to your customers, to the people who  
1:39:33
you're building for. Because you're interacting  with them, you're focusing on them as you plan   and you're interacting with them on a weekly basis  when you work in this way, and how close it brings  
1:39:43
teammates together in a very authentic way. We're working together on the most important  
1:39:48
things. We don't have to navigate the usual social  dynamics of conversations where one person has an  
1:39:54
idea and they're pitching it. We don't have  to navigate the constant context switches   of the calendar that dominates our days. We're just working on the most important  
1:40:03
thing. The structure takes care of a lot  of the difficulty of the process of what  
1:40:10
we should do. We just find people come out of  it with renewed motivation, renewed energy,  
1:40:16
and renewed enthusiasm around the fact that they  get to work on what actually matters to them. Yeah. It just feels like really fun. Just this  part of the process is so fun, and then not having  
1:40:25
to decide how to approach it, having someone  just give you here's a framework to follow. It's like a yoga class, right? It's like,  I don't know how to do yoga, but ...
1:40:32
Just tell me. Explain to me step by step. Yoga for startups. Yeah. That'll be the title for this episode.
1:40:39
[inaudible 01:40:39]. Guys, this was awesome. I'm going to skip the  lightning round just because we've gone long. Cool. I guess just where can folks find you  online? How can listeners be useful to you?
1:40:47
You can find me on LinkedIn. John [inaudible  01:40:51] find you on LinkedIn, too. Yeah. [inaudible 01:40:54].
1:40:53
