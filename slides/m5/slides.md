# Module 5: Managing Flow of Work

*ICP-BAF Business Agility Foundations*

<!--
Welcome to Module 5. We're now at a critical juncture in your business agility journey. You've explored mindset, vision, team alignment, and testing ideas. Today we focus on how work actually flows through your organization—and how to optimize that flow to deliver value faster and more reliably.

# Why Flow Matters for Agility

## The Heart of Business Agility

You can have great vision and strong teams, but if work gets stuck, business agility fails.

<v-click>

> "Flow is the movement of customer value through a system."

> — Mary and Tom Poppendieck

<v-click>

**Key Point:** Managing flow is about making work visible, eliminating waste, limiting work-in-progress, and measuring what matters. It's how strategy becomes reality.

</v-click>

<!--
Think about water flowing through a river. When the river is clear and unobstructed, water flows smoothly. Add rocks, debris, and blockages, and flow slows or stops. Your organization is the same. Today we'll learn to see and remove the obstacles that block flow.

# Learning Outcomes for Today

## By the end of this session, you will be able to:

<v-clicks>

- Discuss Lean Systems thinking and how it enables business agility
- Identify the 7 Wastes in your own work processes
- Explain the 9 kanban values and 4 core kanban practices
- Create a kanban board for your own work process with appropriate WIP limits
- Distinguish iterative frameworks (like Scrum) from flow-based frameworks (like Kanban)
- Explain why leading indicators matter more than lagging indicators
- Make customer value visible through value stream thinking

</v-clicks>

<!--
These outcomes align directly with ICP-BAF certification requirements. Notice the blend of understanding and doing—you'll not just learn about kanban, you'll build a board for your real work. This is practical, hands-on learning.

# Workshop Roadmap

## Our Journey Today:

<v-clicks>

1. **History of Lean Thinking** - From Toyota to knowledge work
2. **Lean Systems Thinking** - End-to-end perspective and 7 Wastes
3. **Making Value Visible** - Value streams and customer outcomes
4. **Kanban Values & Practices** - Visualize, limit WIP, lead with flow
5. **Iterative vs Flow Frameworks** - When to use each
6. **Leading vs Lagging Indicators** - Metrics that matter
7. **Flow as Foundation** - Connecting to business agility

</v-clicks>

<v-click>

**Interactive Elements:** 4 hands-on activities throughout

</v-click>

<!--
We'll move through these topics with a mix of frameworks, real examples, and practical activities. By the end, you'll have tools you can apply immediately to improve flow in your work.

# Origins - The Toyota Production System

## Post-WWII Japan: The Birth of Lean

<div class="grid grid-cols-2 gap-4">
<div>

### The Challenge:
- Japan, 1950s: Limited resources, small market
- American mass production (Ford) required large scale
- Toyota needed a different approach

</div>
<div>

### The Innovation
**Taiichi Ohno & Toyota Production System (TPS):**
- Focus on eliminating waste (muda)
- Respect for people and continuous improvement (kaizen)
- Just-in-time production
- Built-in quality (jidoka - stop and fix problems)
- Pull systems over push systems

</div>
</div>

<v-click>

**Key Insight:** Small batches, continuous flow, and worker empowerment beat mass production

</v-click>

<!--
Taiichi Ohno, Toyota's chief engineer, revolutionized manufacturing. American companies produced in huge batches—make 10,000 units, then switch to make something else. Toyota realized smaller batches with continuous improvement were faster and higher quality. By the 1980s, Toyota was outcompeting Detroit on quality, cost, and speed.

# The Two Pillars of TPS

## Foundation of Lean Thinking

### Pillar 1: Respect for People
- Workers closest to the work know best
- Anyone can stop the line to fix problems
- Continuous learning and improvement
- Psychological safety to surface issues
- Empowerment over command-and-control

::right::

<div class="pl-4">

### Pillar 2: Continuous Improvement (Kaizen)
- Small, incremental improvements every day
- Experimentation encouraged
- Learn from problems, don't hide them
- Gemba (go see) - leaders observe actual work
- Standardize, then improve

<v-click>

### Connection to Business Agility:
These pillars directly map to agile values: respect for people, continuous learning, adaptation, transparency.

</v-click>

</div>

<!--
Notice the parallels to business agility. TPS wasn't just about efficiency—it was about creating a culture where people could learn, improve, and deliver value. This is why Lean thinking translates so powerfully to knowledge work.

# From Manufacturing to Knowledge Work

## The Evolution of Lean

<v-clicks>

### 1990s - Lean Manufacturing Goes Global:
- "The Machine That Changed the World" (MIT study)
- Western companies adopt Lean principles
- Focus on waste elimination and flow

### 2000s - Lean Software Development:
- Mary and Tom Poppendieck adapt TPS to software
- Agile Manifesto echoes Lean principles
- Kanban method emerges (David Anderson)

### 2010s - Lean Startup & Beyond:
- Eric Ries applies Lean to entrepreneurship
- Build-Measure-Learn cycles
- Hypothesis-driven development

### Today - Lean as Foundation for Business Agility:
- Systems thinking over local optimization
- Flow-based work over resource utilization
- Value stream optimization
- Leading indicators and rapid feedback

</v-clicks>

<!--
Lean thinking has evolved from factory floors to software teams to entire organizations. The principles remain: respect people, eliminate waste, optimize flow, improve continuously. Today we'll focus on how these principles enable business agility.

# Why Lean Matters Now

## Lean Thinking Enables Business Agility

### Traditional Management:
- Optimize individual efficiency
- Maximize resource utilization
- Focus on outputs (features shipped, hours worked)
- Functional silos and handoffs
- Annual planning cycles

::right::

<div class="pl-4">

### Lean Systems Approach:
- Optimize end-to-end flow
- Minimize work-in-progress
- Focus on outcomes (customer value delivered)
- Cross-functional value streams
- Continuous adaptation

<v-click>

### Result:
Organizations that apply Lean systems thinking deliver value faster, with higher quality, and adapt more quickly to change.

</v-click>

</div>

<!--
Traditional management optimizes parts. Lean optimizes the whole system. This is the shift required for business agility—from local efficiency to systemic effectiveness. Let's explore what that means.
